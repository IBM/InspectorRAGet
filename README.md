# InspectorRAGet

InspectorRAGet, an introspection platform for RAG evaluation. InspectorRAGet allows the user to analyze aggregate and instance-level performance of RAG systems, using both human and algorithmic metrics as well as annotator quality.

InspectorRAGet has been developed as a [React](https://react.dev/) web application built with [NextJS 14](https://nextjs.org/) framework and the [Carbon Design System](https://carbondesignsystem.com/).

## üé• Demo

##  Usage

Once you have started InspectorRAGet, the next step is import a json file with the evaluation results in the format expected by the platform. You can do this in two ways:
- Use one of our [integration notebooks](#use-inspectorraget-through-integration-notebooks), showing how to use InspectorRAGet in combination with popular evaluation frameworks.
- Manually convert the evaluation results into the expected format by consulting the [documentation of InspectorRAGet's file format](#use-inspectorraget-by-manually-creating-input-file).

## Use InspectorRAGet through integration notebooks

To make it easier to get started, we have created notebooks showcasing how InspectorRAGet can be used in combination with popular evaluation frameworks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use the corresponding framework to run an evaluation experiment and transform its output to the input format expected by InspectorRAGet for analysis. We provide notebooks demonstrating integrations of InspectorRAGet with the following popular frameworks:

| Framework | Description | Integration Notebook |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language Model Evaluation Harness | Popular evaluation framework used to evaluate language models on different tasks | [LM_Eval_Demonstration.ipynb](notebooks/LM_Eval_Demonstration.ipynb) |
| Ragas | Popular evaluation framework specifically designed for the evaluation of RAG systems through LLM-as-a-judge techniques | [Ragas_Demonstration.ipynb](notebooks/Ragas_Demonstration.ipynb) |
| HuggingFace | Offers libraries and assets (incl. datasets, models, and metric evaluators) that can be used to both create and evaluate RAG systems | [HuggingFace_Demonstration.ipynb](notebooks/HuggingFace_Demonstration.ipynb) |

## Use InspectorRAGet by manually creating input file

If you want to use your own code/framework, not covered by the integration notebooks above, to run the evaluation, you can manually transform the evaluation results to the input format expected by InspectorRAGet, described below. Examples of input files in the expected format can be found in the [data](data) folder.  

The experiment results json file expected by InspectorRAGet can be broadly split into six sections along their functional boundaries. The first section captures general details about the experiment in `name`, `description` and `timestamp` fields. The second and third sections describe the
sets of models and metrics used in the experiment via the `models` and `metrics` fields, respectively. The last three sections cover the dataset and the outcome of evaluation experiment in the form of `documents`, `tasks` and `evaluations` fields.

#### 1. Metadata

```json
{
    "name": "Sample experiment name",
    "description": "Sample example description",
    ...
```

#### 2. Models

```json
    "models": [
      {
        "model_id": "model_1",
        "name": "Model 1",
        "owner": "Model 1 owner",
      },
      {
        "model_id": "model_2",
        "name": "Model 2",
        "owner": "Model 2 owner",
      }
    ],
```

Notes: 

1. Each model must have a unique `model_id` and `name`. 

#### 3. Metrics

            "description": "Metric A description",
            "author": "algorithm | human",
            "type": "numerical",
            "aggregator": "average",
            "range": [0, 1, 0.1]
            },
            {
            "name": "metric_b",
            "display_name": "Metric B",

                        "display_value": "A",
                        "numeric_value": 1
                  },
                  {
                        "value": "value_b",
                        "display_value": "B",
                        "numeric_value": 0
                  }
                ]
            },
            {

            "type": "text"
            }
      ],
```
Notes:

1. Each metric must have a unique name.
2. Metric can be of `numerical`, `categorical`, or `text` type. 
3. Numerical type metrics must specify `range` field in `[start, end, bin_size]` format. 
4. Categoricl type metrics must specify `values` field where each value must have `value` and `numerical_value` fields.
5. Text type metric are only accesible in instance level view and not used in any experiment level aggregate statistics and visual elements.

#### 4. Documents

```json
      "documents": [
            {
                  "document_id": "GUID 1",

                  "text": "document text 3",
                  "title": "document title 3"
            }
      ],
```
Notes:

1. Each document must have a unique `document_id` field.
2. Each document must have a `text` field.

#### 5. Tasks

```json
      "filters": ["category"],
      "tasks": [
            {
                  "task_id": "task_1",
                  "task_type": "rag",

                              "text": "Hello"
                        }
                  ],
                  "contexts": [
                        {

                        }
                  ]
            }
      ],
```
Notes: 

1. Each task must have a unique `task_id`.
2. Task type can be of `question_answering`, `conversation`, or of `rag` type.
3. `input` is an array of utterances. An utterance's speaker could be either `user` or `agent`. Each utterance must have a `text` field.
4. `contexts` field represents a subset of documents from the `documents` field relevant to the `input` and is available to the generative models. 
5. `targets` field is an array of expected gold or reference texts. 
6. `category` is an optional field that represents the type of task for grouping similar tasks.
7. `filters` is a top-level field (parallel to `tasks`) which specifies an array of fields defined inside `tasks` for filtering tasks during analysis. 

#### 6. Evaluations

```json
"evaluations": [
      {
            "task_id": "task_1 | task_2",
            "model_id": "model_1 | model_2",
            "model_response": "Model response",
            "annotations": {
                  "metric_a": {
                        "system": {
                              "value": 0.233766233766233
                        }
                  },
                  "metric_b": {
                        "system": {
                              "value": "value_a | value_b"
                        }
                  },
                  "metric_c": {
                        "system": {
                              "value": "text"
                        }
                  },
            }
      }
]
```
Notes:

1. `evaluations` field must contain evaluation for every model defined in `models` section and on every task in `tasks` section. Thus, total number of evaluations is equal to number of models (M) X number of tasks (T) = M X T
2. Each evaluation must be associated with single task and single model.
3. Each evaluation must have model prediction on a task captured in the `model_response` field. 
4. `annotations` field captures ratings on the model for a given task and for every metric specified in the `metrics` field.
5. Each metric annotation is a dictionary containing worker ids as keys. In the example above, `system` is a worker id. 
6. Annotation from any worker on all metrics must be in the form of a dictionary. At minimum, such dictionary contains `value` key capturing model's rating for the metric by the worker.
