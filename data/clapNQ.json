In April 2007 , soon after these results were published , Ken Kutaragi , President of Sony Computer Entertainment , announced plans to retire .

When a morpheme stands by itself , it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own ( e.g. the morpheme cat ) and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea , it is an affix because it has a grammatical function ( e.g. the -- s in cats to indicate that it is plural ) .

The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .",

Again on October 19 , 1960 ( almost two years after the Batista regime was deposed by the Cuban Revolution ) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American - owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation . On February 7 , 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports . Currently , the Cuban embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes : the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 , the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963 , the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 , the Helms -- Burton Act of 1996 , and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 . The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward `` democratization and greater respect for human rights '' . The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba .

On February 7, 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports. Currently, the Cuban embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes: the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the Helms--Burton Act of 1996, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. In 1999, President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba."
