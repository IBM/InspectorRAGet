Any predictable change or pattern in a time series that recurs or repeats over a one - year period can be said to be seasonal . It is common in many situations -- such as grocery store or even in a Medical Examiner 's office -- that the demand depends on the day of the week . In such situations , the forecasting procedure calculates the seasonal index of the `` season '' -- seven seasons , one for each day -- which is the ratio of the average demand of that season ( which is calculated by Moving Average or Exponential Smoothing using historical data corresponding only to that season ) to the average demand across all seasons . An index higher than 1 indicates that demand is higher than average ; an index less than 1 indicates that the demand is less than the average . ",

The prime minister is , instead , the head of government and is responsible for advising the Crown on how to exercise the Royal Prerogative and its executive powers , which are governed by the constitution and its conventions . However , the function of the prime minister has evolved with increasing power . Today , as per the doctrines of constitutional monarchy , the advice given by the prime minister is ordinarily binding , meaning the prime minister effectively carries out those duties ascribed to the sovereign or governor general , leaving the latter to act in predominantly ceremonial fashions . As such , the prime minister , supported by the Office of the Prime Minister ( PMO ) , controls the appointments of many key figures in Canada 's system of governance , including the governor general , the Cabinet , justices of the Supreme Court , senators , heads of crown corporations , ambassadors to foreign countries , the provincial lieutenant governors , and approximately 3,100 other positions . Further , the prime minister plays a prominent role in the legislative process -- with the majority of bills put before parliament originating in the Cabinet -- and the leadership of the Canadian Armed Forces .

It regulates the metabolism of carbohydrates , fats and protein by promoting the absorption of , especially glucose from the blood into liver , fat and skeletal muscle cells . In these tissues the absorbed glucose is converted into either glycogen via glycogenesis or fats ( triglycerides ) via lipogenesis , or , in the case of the liver , into both . Glucose production and secretion by the liver is strongly inhibited by high concentrations of insulin in the blood . Circulating insulin also affects the synthesis of proteins in a wide variety of tissues . It is therefore an anabolic hormone , promoting the conversion of small molecules in the blood into large molecules inside the cells . Low insulin levels in the blood have the opposite effect by promoting widespread catabolism , especially of reserve body fat . ",

Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

In this practice , the seaman paraded a straw - stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard .

If they got advances from the ship 's paymaster , they would incur debt . This period was called the `` dead horse '' time , and it usually lasted a month or two . The seaman 's ceremony was to celebrate having worked off the `` dead horse '' debt .

Along unmyelinated fibers , impulses continuously move as waves , but , in myelinated fibers , they `` hop '' or propagate by saltatory conduction . Myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane ( the axolemma ) . Thus , myelination prevents the electric current from leaving the axon . It has been suggested that myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts . ",

He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother .

Subsequently in 1377 , the world 's oldest extant movable metal print book , Jikji , was printed in Korea during the Goryeo dynasty . Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor . Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead , tin , and antimony -- and these materials remained standard for 550 years . ",

The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax .

Constructed by the German Democratic Republic ( GDR , East Germany ) , starting on 13 August 1961 , the Wall cut off ( by land ) West Berlin from virtually all of surrounding East Germany and East Berlin until government officials opened it in November 1989 . Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and finished in 1992 . The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls , accompanied by a wide area ( later known as the `` death strip '' ) that contained anti-vehicle trenches , `` fakir beds '' and other defenses . The Eastern Bloc portrayed the Wall as protecting its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the `` will of the people '' in building a socialist state in East Germany . ",

Whereas sonar could not distinguish man - made debris on the sea bed from natural objects , cameras could . The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens . One of them was identified as a boiler , identical to those shown in pictures from 1911 .

At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals . ",

The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 . ",

Since the establishment of the first shogunate in 1199 , the Emperors of Japan have rarely taken on a role as supreme battlefield commander , unlike many Western monarchs . Japanese Emperors have nearly always been controlled by external political forces , to varying degrees . In fact , between 1192 and 1867 , the sh\u014dguns , or their shikken regents in Kamakura ( 1203 -- 1333 ) , were the de facto rulers of Japan , although they were nominally appointed by the Emperor . After the Meiji Restoration in 1867 , the Emperor was the embodiment of all sovereign power in the realm , as enshrined in the Meiji Constitution of 1889 . Since the enactment of the 1947 Constitution , he has been a ceremonial head of state without even nominal political powers . ",

The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west - northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 -- 25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day . Hours later , Harvey made landfall near Rockport , Texas , at peak intensity . Afterwards , rapid weakening ensued , and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state , dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state . On August 28 , it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico , strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 . As Harvey drifted inland , it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 , before dissipating two days later . ",

In cells with a nucleus , as in eukaryotes , the cell cycle is also divided into three periods : interphase , the mitotic ( M ) phase , and cytokinesis . During interphase , the cell grows , accumulating nutrients needed for mitosis , preparing it for a big cell division and duplicating its DNA . During the mitotic phase , the chromosomes separate . During the final stage , cytokinesis , the chromosomes and cytoplasm separate into two new daughter cells .

He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group .

The interaction that takes place within the poem is commonly thought to be between a white colonialist and an African native . The poem follows a trope in African literature of `` The White Man Laughed '' , which embodies the notion of dismay and cynical derision of the beliefs , practices , and norms of an African . However , Okara 's poem can be seen to transcend the acceptance of the derision of the White Man and present a wiser African intellectual . The poem concludes with the African teaching the White Man of his ignorance and helping him realize that the native beliefs of the African are not primitive nor removed from intellectual thought . ",

The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble . The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) long , with a drop of some 50 feet ( 15 m ) through the limestone strata . The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 . A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast . Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B.

The second being a somatic cell , referring to the cells of the human body . Skin cells , fat cells , and liver cells are only a few examples . The nucleus of the donor egg cell is removed and discarded , leaving it ' deprogrammed . ' What is left is a somatic cell and an denucleated egg cell .

The ovum , now containing the somatic cell 's nucleus , is stimulated with a shock and will begin to divide . The egg is now viable and capable of producing an adult organism containing all the necessary genetic information from just one parent . Development will ensue normally and after many mitotic divisions , this single cell forms a blastocyst ( an early stage embryo with about 100 cells ) with an identical genome to the original organism ( i.e. a clone ) .

      "text": "According to Ban Gu , writing in the Book of Han , the Analects originated as individual records kept by Confucius 's disciples of conversations between the Master and them , which were then collected and jointly edited by the disciples after Confucius 's death in 479 BC . The work is therefore titled Lunyu meaning `` edited conversations '' or `` selected speeches '' ( i.e. analects ) . This broadly forms the traditional account of the genesis of the work accepted by later generations of scholars , for example the Song dynasty neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi stated that Analects is the records of Confucius 's first - and second - generation pupils . The view however was challenged by Qing dynasty philologist Cui Shu ( \u5d14 \u8ff0 , 1740 -- 1816 ) who argued on linguistic ground that the last five books are much later than the rest of the work . Many modern scholars now believe that the work was compiled over a period of around two hundred years , with some questioning the authenticity of some of the sayings . Because no texts of the Analects have been discovered earlier , and because the Analects was not referred to by name in any existing source before the early Han dynasty , some scholars have proposed dates as late as 140 BC for the text 's compilation .

      "text": "Cobalt - 60 , Co , is a synthetic radioactive isotope of cobalt with a half - life of 5.2714 years . It is produced artificially in nuclear reactors . Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n \u2192 Co \u2192 Ni + e + \u03bd + gamma rays . ",

Studies from 2007 -- 2010 applied molecular markers and studied the skull and skeletal morphology of current and mummified animals , thereby revealing the ancestor to most likely be Cavia tschudii . Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them . ",

The idea was not completely new : since 1975 / 1976 proposals for an Olympic boycott circulated widely among human rights activists and groups as a sanction for Soviet violations of human rights . At that moment , not many of the member governments were interested in the proposal . The idea began to gain popularity in early January 1980 when Russian dissident Andrei Sakharov called for a boycott . On 14 January 1980 , the Carter Administration joined Sakharov 's appeal and set a deadline by which the Soviet Union must pull out of Afghanistan or face the consequences , including an international boycott of the games . On 26 January 1980 , Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark announced that Canada , like the US , would boycott the Olympic Games if Soviet forces did not leave Afghanistan by 20 February 1980 . ",

The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .

It comprised West Bengal with a Hindu majority and East Bengal and Assam with a Muslim majority . It included the Hindi - speaking regions of Bihar , the Odia - speaking regions of Odisha as well as the Assamese - speaking region of Assam , making it a huge administrative entity . Moreover , the capital , Calcutta , was also the capital of the entire British India . With the growing efforts of the Indian freedom fighters to secure the independence of India , Lord Curzon decided to address both these problems by partitioning Bengal into two entities , which would result in a Muslim - majority in the eastern half , and a Hindu - majority in the western half . This he hoped would reduce the administrative pressures . ",

'' Jose V. Pardo has his M.D and Ph. D and leads a research program in cognitive neuroscience . Using positron emission tomography ( PET ) Pardo and his colleagues were able to provoke sadness among seven normal men and women by asking them to think about sad things . They observed increased brain activity in the bilateral inferior and orbitofrontal cortex . In a study that induced sadness in subjects by showing emotional film clips , the feeling was correlated with significant increases in regional brain activity , especially in the prefrontal cortex , in the region called Brodmann 's area 9 , and the thalamus . A significant increase in activity was also observed in the bilateral anterior temporal structures . ",

      "text": "It is difficult to assess Shakespeare 's reputation in his own lifetime and shortly after . England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition . ",

The perceived military incompetence at First Bull Run and Ball 's Bluff led to the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War , a congressional body created to investigate Northern military affairs . Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen.

If positive represents a movement to the right , negative represents a movement to the left . If positive represents above sea level , then negative represents below sea level . If positive represents a deposit , negative represents a withdrawal . They are often used to represent the magnitude of a loss or deficiency . A debt that is owed may be thought of as a negative asset , a decrease in some quantity may be thought of as a negative increase . If a quantity may have either of two opposite senses , then one may choose to distinguish between those senses -- perhaps arbitrarily -- as positive and negative . In the medical context of fighting a tumor , an expansion could be thought of as a negative shrinkage . Negative numbers are used to describe values on a scale that goes below zero , such as the Celsius and Fahrenheit scales for temperature . The laws of arithmetic for negative numbers ensure that the common sense idea of an opposite is reflected in arithmetic . For example , \u2212 ( \u2212 3 ) = 3 because the opposite of an opposite is the original thing . ",

Prior to the Mini\u00e9 ball , bullets had to be jammed down the rifle barrel , sometimes with a mallet , and after a relatively small number of shots , gunpowder residue built up in the spiral grooves , which then had to be cleaned out .

The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba . In 2000 , Clinton authorized the sale of `` humanitarian '' U.S. products to Cuba . ",

The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane . The endoplasmic reticulum occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells , but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa . There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum : rough and smooth . The outer ( cytosolic ) face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis . The rough endoplasmic reticulum is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes . The smooth endoplasmic reticulum lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism , the production of steroid hormones , and detoxification . The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells . The lacy membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy . ",

The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million ( 6th century outbreak ) to 50 million people ( two centuries of recurrence ) . The historian Procopius wrote , in Volume II of History of the Wars , of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire . In the spring of 542 , the plague arrived in Constantinople , working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea , later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy . Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian 's efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies , his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague . Procopius , in his work Secret History , declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness . ",

The author used a variety of pre-existing sources , such as conflict stories ( Mark 2 : 1 -- 3 : 6 ) , apocalyptic discourse ( 4 : 1 -- 35 ) , and collections of sayings ( although not the Gospel of Thomas and probably not the Q source ) .

This fearlessness and its inability to fly made the dodo easy prey for sailors . Although some scattered reports describe mass killings of dodos for ships ' provisions , archaeological investigations have found scant evidence of human predation . Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century , which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high , broken terrain . The human population on Mauritius ( an area of 1,860 km or 720 sq mi ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century , but they introduced other animals , including dogs , pigs , cats , rats , and crab - eating macaques , which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources . At the same time , humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos . The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population , especially the pigs and macaques , is today considered more severe than that of hunting . Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests , since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs . ",

It is based upon the following thought experiment : people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents , abilities , tastes , social class , and positions they will have within a social order . When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights , positions , and resources in the society in which they will live , this `` veil of ignorance '' prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights , positions , and resources in that society . For example , for a proposed society in which 50 % of the population is kept in slavery , it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50 % likelihood that the participant would be a slave . The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations , since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self - or class - interest .

The Federal Open Market Committee ( FOMC ) sets monetary policy ; it consists of all seven members of the Board of Governors and the twelve regional bank presidents , though only five bank presidents vote at any given time : the president of the New York Fed and four others who rotate through one - year terms . There are also various advisory councils . Thus , the Federal Reserve System has both public and private components . The structure is considered unique among central banks . It is also unusual in that the United States Department of the Treasury , an entity outside of the central bank , prints the currency used . ",

The Pilgrims ' leadership came from the religious congregations of Brownist separatist Puritans who had fled the volatile political environment in England for the relative calm and tolerance of 17th - century Holland in the Netherlands . They held Puritan Calvinist religious beliefs but , unlike other Puritans , they maintained that their congregations needed to be separated from the English state church . They were also concerned that they might lose their English cultural identity if they remained in the Netherlands , so they arranged with English investors to establish a new colony in North America . The colony was established in 1621 and became the second successful English settlement in North America ( after the founding of Jamestown , Virginia in 1607 ) . The Pilgrims ' story became a central theme of the history and culture of the United States . ",

Proto - oncogenes code for proteins that help to regulate the cell growth and differentiation . Proto - oncogenes are often involved in signal transduction and execution of mitogenic signals , usually through their protein products . Upon acquiring an activating mutation , a proto - oncogene becomes a tumor - inducing agent , an oncogene . Examples of proto - oncogenes include RAS , WNT , MYC , ERK , and TRK . The MYC gene is implicated in Burkitt 's lymphoma , which starts when a chromosomal translocation moves an enhancer sequence within the vicinity of the MYC gene . The MYC gene codes for widely used transcription factors . When the enhancer sequence is wrongly placed , these transcription factors are produced at much higher rates . Another example of an oncogene is the Bcr - Abl gene found on the Philadelphia chromosome , a piece of genetic material seen in Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia caused by the translocation of pieces from chromosomes 9 and 22 . Bcr - Abl codes for a tyrosine kinase , which is constitutively active , leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation . ( More information about the Philadelphia Chromosome below ) ",

The government protected its merchants -- and kept others out -- through trade barriers , regulations , and subsidies to domestic industries in order to maximize exports from and minimize imports to the realm . The government had to fight smuggling , which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French , Spanish , or Dutch . The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses , so that gold and silver would pour into London . The government took its share through duties and taxes , with the remainder going to merchants in Britain . The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy , which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires , and sometimes seized them . Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam ( New York ) in 1664 . The colonies were captive markets for British industry , and the goal was to enrich the mother country . ",

In 1884 , the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter ( known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur - Chamberland filter ) with pores smaller than bacteria . Thus , he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them . In 1892 , the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus . His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration . Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria , but did not pursue the idea . At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium -- this was part of the germ theory of disease . In 1898 , the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent . He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing , but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles , he called it a contagium vivum fluidum ( soluble living germ ) and re-introduced the word virus . Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature , a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley , who proved they were particulate . In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus -- agent of foot - and - mouth disease ( aphthovirus ) -- through a similar filter . ",

The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year .

The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards .

The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain , to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations , to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act , and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies . The Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) were met with resistance in the colonies , prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768 , which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770 . ",

It was originally home to lake whitefish , lake trout , yellow perch , panfish , largemouth bass , smallmouth bass and bowfin , as well as some species of catfish . As a result of improvements to the Welland Canal in 1919 , an invasion of sea lampreys and overharvesting , there has been a decline in native lake trout populations , ultimately causing an increase in the population of another invasive species , the alewife . As a result , salmonids , including various strains of brown trout , steelhead ( rainbow trout ) , coho and chinook salmon , were introduced as predators in order to decrease the alewife population . This program was so successful that the introduced population of trout and salmon exploded , resulting in the creation of a large sport fishery for these introduced species . Lake Michigan is now stocked annually with steelhead , brown trout , and coho and chinook salmon , which have also begun natural reproduction in some Lake Michigan tributaries . However , several introduced invasive species , such as lampreys , round goby , zebra mussels and quagga mussels , continue to cause major changes in water clarity and fertility , resulting in knock - on changes to Lake Michigan 's ecosystem , threatening the vitality of native fish populations .

It was here in 1901 the term `` tractor '' with Latin roots and a combination of the words traction and power was first coined by Hart and Parr . In 1903 the firm built fifteen `` tractors '' , the first successful production - model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000 pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. In 1929 , Hart - Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers .

As recently as the 1950s , it was still common on family farms in North America and Europe to grow much of a family 's own food and make much of its own clothing , although sales of some of the farm 's production earned enough currency to buy certain staples , typically including sugar ; coffee and tea ; petroleum distillates ( petrol , kerosene , fuel oil ) ; textile products such as bolts of cloth , needles , and thread ; medicines ; hardware products such as nails , screws , and wire ; and a few discretionary items such as candy or books .

This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers . The following day , the revolutionaries began flying their own flag , clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789 . To maintain order , several bourgeois militia groups were formed . The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country . King William I rejected his son 's advice to negotiate with the rebels , forcing them towards a more radical , pro-independence stance , and sent a large military force to Brussels to suppress the insurrection .

Two surveys on physicists , geoscientists , biologists , mathematicians , and chemists have noted that , from those specializing in these fields , physicists had lowest percentage of belief in God ( 29 % ) while chemists had highest ( 41 % ) . Other studies show that among members of the National Academy of Sciences , concerning the existence of a personal god who answers prayer , 7 % expressed belief , 72 % expressed disbelief , and 21 % were agnostic , however Eugenie Scott argued that there are methodological issues in the study , including ambiguity in the questions .

The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible .

According to a 2007 study in Quaternary Science Reviews , `` Between AD 1050 and 1100 , Cahokia 's population increased from between 1400 and 2800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people '' . an estimate that applies only to a 1.8 km2 high density central occupation area . Archaeologists estimate the city 's population at between 6,000 and 40,000 at its peak , with more people living in outlying farming villages that supplied the main urban center . In the early 21st century , new residential areas were found to the west of Cahokia as a result of archeological excavations , increasing estimates of area population .

As with British theorists , French colonial officials like F\u00e9lix Ebou\u00e9 or Robert Delavignette wrote and argued throughout the first half of the 20th century for a distinct French style of rule that was centralized , uniform , and aimed at assimilating colonial subjects into the French polity . French rule , sometimes labeled Jacobin , was said in these writings to be based on the twin ideologies of the centralized unitary French government of the Metropole , with the French colonial ideology of Assimilation . Colonial Assimilation argued that French law and citizenship was based on universal values that came from the French Revolution . Mirroring French domestic citizenship law , French colonial law allowed for anyone who could prove themselves culturally French ( the `` \u00c9volu\u00e9s '' ) to become equal French citizens . In French West Africa , only parts of the Senegalese `` Four Communes '' ever extended French citizenship outside a few educated African elite .

However , the stock price reached an all - time peak that year , which was not surpassed for the next decade , as the company ran into troubles through the early 1990s . In 1986 , Pinnacle acquired MeraBank , a savings and loan . It grew to become Arizona 's largest thrift , with $6.5 billion in assets . However , the thrift was seized by federal regulators in January 1990 , due in part to the deterioration in prices in the Arizona real estate market .",

      "text": "Inclusion : Deaf students spend all , or most , of the school day with non-deaf students . Since inclusion requires considerable curriculum modification , it is considered best practice only for mildly - to - moderately deaf students . Specialized services may be provided inside or outside the regular classroom , and students may leave the regular classroom to attend smaller , intensive instructional sessions in a resource room or to receive other services requiring specialized equipment or which might be disruptive to the rest of the class ( such as speech and language therapy ) . Mainstreaming refers to the education of deaf students in classes with non-deaf students for specified time periods , based on the deaf students ' skills ; deaf students learn in separate classes for the remainder of the school day . Segregation ( in a separate classroom or school ) : In this model , deaf students spend no time in non-deaf classes or with non-deaf students . Segregated students may attend a school where non-deaf classes are provided , but spend their time in a separate classroom for students with special needs . If their special - needs class is in a mainstream school , they may have opportunities for social integration ( for example , eating meals with non-deaf students ) ; alternatively , deaf students may attend a special school . Exclusion : A student unable to receive instruction in any school is excluded from school . Most deaf students have historically been excluded from school , and exclusion may still occur where there is no legal mandate for special - education services ( such as developing countries ) . It may also occur when a student is in hospital or housebound . Excluded students may receive individual or group instruction , and students who have been suspended or expelled are not considered `` excluded '' in this sense .",

The word may also be used to cover both concepts .

On November 1 , 2017 , MTV News reported that the collaboration will be titled `` \u00c9chame la Culpa '' , a song Fonsi has been performing solo during live shows across the summer . In an interview with Billboard at iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina in Miami , Fonsi admitted : `` It 's a fun song , a fun record , we already filmed the video . '' He also revealed that the song would premiere in two weeks . In a clip shared by Billboard on November 13 , 2017 , Lovato and Fonsi can be seen meeting each other via a FaceTime call to discuss details about their collaboration . On November 14 , 2017 , Lovato took to social media to announce the release date , along with a snippet of the song featuring only her part , as Fonsi posted a shot of himself lying in bed with pillows covered in the song 's title . On November 17 , 2017 , Fonsi published a photo of a truck with him and Lovato on it , as well as short quotes including `` \u00bf Qu\u00e9 pasa Demi ?

      "text": "Before 1981 the approval process of Justices was usually rapid . From the Truman through Nixon administrations , Justices were typically approved within one month . From the Reagan administration to the present , however , the process has taken much longer . According to the Congressional Research Service , the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days ( 2.2 months ) , while the median is 71 days ( or 2.3 months ) . Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past . The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism . For example , columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork 's nomination `` unjust '' and , more generally , that the nomination process does `` not delve deeply into the nominee 's jurisprudential thinking . '' Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left , middle , or right . One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage ; before 1925 , nominees were never questioned ; after 1955 , every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions ; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits ( before 1980 ) to double digits today . Another example of the politicization of the process was the Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination , which remained before the Senate far longer than any other nominee .",

During the Sino - Japanese War ( 1937 -- 1945 ) , the loss of Manchuria , and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries , was a blow to the Kuomintang economy . The League of Nations , established at the end of World War I , was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance . After 1940 , conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control .

Her The Face of the Deep is a meditation upon the Apocalypse . In her view , what Revelation has to teach is patience . Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows . Her book , which is largely written in prose , frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation , much like Revelation itself . The relevance of John 's visions belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation . Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning . `` That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination . Winter that returns not to spring ... -- who can bear it ? '' She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John 's message . `` A few are charged to do judgment ; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy . '' Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as `` representative of all his brethren '' so they should `` hope as he hoped , love as he loved . ''",

The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow layer of snow and , had there been an avalanche of sufficient strength to sweep away the second party , these bodies would have been swept away as well ; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line . Over 100 expeditions to the region were held since the incident , and none of them ever reported conditions that might create an avalanche . A study of the area using up - to - date terrain - related physics revealed that the location was entirely unlikely for such an avalanche to have occurred . The `` dangerous conditions '' found in another nearby area ( which had significantly steeper slopes and cornices ) were observed in April and May when the snowfalls of winter were melting . During February , when the incident occurred , there were no such conditions . An analysis of the terrain , the slope and the incline indicates that even if there could have been a very specific avalanche that circumvents the other criticisms , its trajectory would have bypassed the tent . It had collapsed laterally but not horizontally . Dyatlov was an experienced skier and the much older Alexander Zolotaryov was studying for his Masters Certificate in ski instruction and mountain hiking . Neither of these two men would have been likely to camp anywhere in the path of a potential avalanche .",

While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority , the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely .

North Korea did not respond to the suit . In December 2008 , U.S. District Judge Henry H.

The mission was planned to be a three - day test , to include the first Soviet docking with an unpiloted Soyuz 2 , but the mission was plagued with problems . Early on , Komarov 's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed . Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely , resulting in the craft spinning wildly . Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system , which was only partially effective . The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day . During the emergency re-entry , a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail , and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute ; Komarov was killed on impact . Fixing the spacecraft faults caused an eighteen - month delay before piloted Soyuz flights could resume .",

In the same way after the United States threw its weight behind Ngo Dinh Diem , who became South Vietnam 's president in 1955 , journals in the United States ignored the new leader 's despotic tendencies and instead highlighted his anticommunism . The death of civilians in a coup against President Diem at the end of 1960 started to change how Vietnam was viewed by the media . As a result , the New York Times sent the first reporter to Saigon , the capital of South Vietnam . This was followed by other journalists arriving from Reuters , AFP , Time and Newsweek . The basic policy governing how the US mission in Saigon handled these reporters reflected the way the administration of President John F. Kennedy conceived of the American role in the war . Under that framework , the Americans ' role in South Vietnam was only to render advice and support in that nation 's war against the Communists .",

Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established and by the end of 1950 , just 4.5 % of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units ; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives , of which there were now around 14,700 . Rural life changed as farmers ' daily movements were dictated to by plans , decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy . The new kolkhozes , especially smaller ones , were ill - equipped and poor -- at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash , but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz . Farmers still had small pieces of land ( not larger than 0.5 ha ) around their houses where they grew food for themselves .

Lacking sufficient supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and , on 27 September 1694 , recapturing Huy , an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur . Elsewhere , de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October ; while in Italy , the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat 's push into Piedmont . However , in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful . On 27 May Marshal Noailles , supported by French warships , soundly defeated the Marquis of Escalona 's Spanish forces at the Battle of Torroella on the banks of the river Ter ; the French proceeded to take Palam\u00f3s on 10 June , Gerona on 29 June , and Hostalric , opening the route to Barcelona . With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance William III prepared the Anglo - Dutch fleet for action . Part of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north , first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June , before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe , Saint - Malo , Le Havre , and Calais . The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean , linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz . The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon , which , in turn , forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter , harassed en route by General Trinxer\u00eda 's miquelets . By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years . Siege",

After the film 's success , Asprey & Garrard were commissioned to create an authentic Heart of the Ocean necklace using the original design . The result was a platinum - set , 171 - carat ( 34.2 g ) heart - shaped Ceylon sapphire surrounded by 103 diamonds . This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart . The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round , pear , and marquise cut white diamonds . The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone . The necklace was donated to Sotheby 's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California 's Aid For AIDS . It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client for $1.4 million , under the agreement that Celine Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony .

Banksy was inspired by local artists and their work was part of the larger Bristol underground scene with Nick Walker , Inkie and 3D . During this time Banksy met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides , who began selling Banksy 's work , later becoming their agent . By 2000 Banksy had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work . Banksy claims they changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry , when they noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique , they soon became more widely noticed for their art around Bristol and London . Banksy was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s , and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001 . Banksy 's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors ' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol .

Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one . In practice , ' he that is not with me is against me ' . The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle , while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you , is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security .

The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million ( 6th century outbreak ) to 50 million people ( two centuries of recurrence ) . The historian Procopius wrote , in Volume II of History of the Wars , of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire . In the spring of 542 , the plague arrived in Constantinople , working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea , later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy . Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian 's efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies , his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague . Procopius , in his work Secret History , declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness .",

Under the responsibility system , household incomes depended on the number of workers in each household and the household 's success in holding down production costs and in supplying goods and services to local markets . Most of the rural families with the highest incomes - the `` 10,000 - yuan households '' - were `` specialized households '' that concentrated family efforts on supplying a particular service or good . Many of these families owned their own equipment , such as trucks or specialized buildings , and operated essentially as private concerns . An increasingly important influence on rural incomes in the mid-1980s was the expansion of nonagricultural rural enterprises , often referred to as `` township enterprises . '' These were factories , construction teams , and processing operations , most of which were owned by collectives , primarily villages , towns , and townships . Some were owned by voluntary groups of families . Township enterprises were considered by the government to be the main source of employment for rural workers who were leaving agriculture because of rising productivity under the responsibility system . By the end of 1986 , township enterprises employed 21 percent of the rural labor force . The movement of rural labor into township enterprises helped to increase average rural incomes because of the higher productivity in nonagricultural jobs . In 1986 industrial workers in rural areas produced an average annual value of \u00a5 4,300 per person , compared with about \u00a5 1,000 per farmer in the same year .",

Adopting a proposal made by Louis de Broglie in 1924 that particles of matter have a dual nature and in some situations act like waves , Schr\u00f6dinger introduced a theory describing the behaviour of such a system by a wave equation that is now known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation . The solutions to Schr\u00f6dinger 's equation , unlike the solutions to Newton 's equations , are wave functions that can only be related to the probable occurrence of physical events . The readily visualized sequence of events of the planetary orbits of Newton is , in quantum mechanics , replaced by the more abstract notion of probability . ( This aspect of the quantum theory made Schr\u00f6dinger and several other physicists profoundly unhappy , and he devoted much of his later life to formulating philosophical objections to the generally accepted interpretation of the theory that he had done so much to create . )",

The name of the band is an `` ironic jab '' at the people who called Gomez a `` wannabe scene . '' The group released their debut studio album in August 2009 , which debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States , with first - week sales of 66,000 copies . The album received a mixed reception , some critics praised the album for its `` fun '' nature , while others criticized Gomez for her vocal performance . The lead single failed to have commercial success , however the second single was successful . With heavy promotion through Disney and performances , the song had success on radio and with sales . In 2010 , Gomez starred as one of the two female leads in Ramona and Beezus , a film adaption of the children 's novel series by Beverly Cleary . The film premiered on July 23 , 2010 , and it was met with generally positive reviews . Selena Gomez & the Scene released their second studio album A Year Without Rain that same year , which debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 4 with sales of a little over 66,000 . The album received mixed to positive reviews where some noticed that Gomez 's vocals contained the Auto - Tune effect . The record 's two singles both achieved moderate success . Having previously announced plans to launch a fashion line , Gomez launched Dream Out Loud in 2010 . The collection consisted of , and featured , bohemian dresses , floral tops , jeans , skirts , jackets , scarves and hats , all of which were made from recycled or eco-friendly materials . Gomez stated , `` With my line , I really want to give the customer options on how they can put their own looks together ( ... ) I want the pieces that can be easy to dress up or down , and the fabrics being eco-friendly and organic is super important ( ... ) Also , the tags will all have some of my inspirational quotes on them . I 'm just looking to send a good message . '' To design the actual items , Gomez teamed up with designers Tony Melillo and Sandra Campos , both of whom had previously worked with big - name fashion houses . Melillo and Campos teamed with New York - based Adjmi Apparel to manufacture the brand , which was formed by Adjmi CH Brands LLC , the holding company for the brand .",

In Spielberg 's version , these invaders had been here before , long ago , in prehistoric times . They had set up their machines deep underground , and departed . Why ? Why not take over the Earth right there and then ? Spielberg does not provide an answer , and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this . An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer . The invaders were interested in humans as food animals . When they came here before , humans were very scarce . The aliens left their hidden machines and departed , patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back , to take over . Under this interpretation , all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm , destined to be ' harvested ' '' .",

All the new successor states were compelled to sign minority rights treaties as a precondition of diplomatic recognition . It was agreed that although the new states had been recognized , they had not been ' created ' before the signatures of the final peace treaties . The issue of German and Polish rights was a point of dispute as Polish rights in Germany remained unprotected , unlike the German minority in Poland . Like other principles adopted by the League , the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations ; like the League itself , the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments , with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s . Despite the political failure , they remained the basis of international law .

The claim was recognized by the Orthodox Patriarch of Constantinople , but not by Roman Catholic Western Europe . Gennadios ( Georgios Scholarios ) , a staunch enemy of the West , had been enthroned Patriarch of Constantinople with all the ceremonial attributes of Byzantium by Mehmed himself acting as Roman Emperor and in turn Gennadios recognized Mehmed as successor to the throne . Mehmed 's claim rested with the concept that Constantinople was the seat of the Roman Empire , after the transfer of its capital to Constantinople in 330 AD and the fall of the Western Roman Empire . Mehmed also had a blood lineage to the Byzantine Imperial family ; his predecessor , Sultan Orhan I had married a Byzantine princess , and Mehmed may have claimed descent from John Tzelepes Komnenos . During that period the Ottoman Empire also destroyed Otranto and its people , and Mehmed II was planning on taking Rome itself when the Italian campaign was cut short by his sudden death . The title fell into disuse after his death , but the imperial bodies created by Mehmed II lived on for centuries to come .",

Although elements of organizational intelligence collection have been a part of business for many years , the history of competitive intelligence arguably began in the U.S. in the 1970s , although the literature on the field pre-dates this time by at least several decades . In 1980 , Michael Porter published the study Competitive - Strategy : Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors which is widely viewed as the foundation of modern competitive intelligence . This has since been extended most notably by the pair of Craig Fleisher and Babette Bensoussan , who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added 48 commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner 's tool box . In 1985 , Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence . However , the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to 1988 , when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function , which was then adopted widely by US companies . The first professional certification program ( CIP ) was created in 1996 with the establishment of The Fuld - Gilad - Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence in Cambridge , Massachusetts .",

      "text": "Wedding banquets In Chinese society , the wedding banquet is known as x\u01d0 - j\u01d0u ( \u559c\u9152 , lit . joyful wine ) , and is sometimes far more important than the actual wedding itself . There are ceremonies such as the bride presenting wines or tea to parents , spouse , and guests . In modern weddings , the bride generally picks red ( following Chinese tradition ) or white ( more Western ) for the wedding , but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquet . Traditionally , the groom is not responsible for the cost of the wedding invitation sweet treats ( often pastries ) , the banquet invitations , and the wedding itself . Wedding banquets are elaborate and consist usually of 5 - 10 courses , with ingredients such as shark fin , abalone , lobster , squab , sea cucumber , swift nests or fish roe in soup or as decoration on top of a dish to symbolize fertility , and local delicacies . Traditionally , the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride 's side and the alcohol consumed during both banquets . The wedding banquets are two separate banquets : the primary banquet is hosted once at the bride 's side , the second banquet ( smaller banquet ) at the groom 's side . While the wedding itself is often based on the couple 's choices , the wedding banquets are a gesture of thanks and appreciation , to those that have raised the bride and groom ( such as grandparents and uncles ) . It is also to ensure the relatives on each side meet the relatives on the other side . Thus out of respect for the elders , wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally , which the older generation is thought to be more comfortable with . On the night of the wedding day , there was a custom in some places for relatives or friends to banter the newlyweds . Though this seemed a little noisy , both of them dropped shyness and got familiar with each other . On the third day of the marriage , the new couple would go back to the bride 's parents ' home . They would be received with also a dinner party including relatives .",

In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty , the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications . Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern - day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 . Western Xia had already fallen in 1227 , and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279 .",

Spanish scholars , because of the geographic proximity , trade , and constant warfare with the Muslim kingdoms of Southern Spain , saw a potential in the simplicity of Arabic numbers , and decided to adopt those symbols , and later other Europeans followed suit . There are two typographic styles for rendering European numerals , known as lining figures and text figures . The Arabic -- Indic or Eastern Arabic numerals , used with the Arabic script , developed primarily in what is now Iraq . A variant of the Eastern Arabic numerals used in the Persian and Urdu languages is shown below as East Arabic - Indic .

Defense of traditional gender roles proved to be a useful tactic . In Illinois , supporters of Phyllis Schlafly , a conservative Republican activist from Illinois , used traditional symbols of the American housewife .

It was suggested that single - sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same - sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed . Traditional women started to oppose the ERA . Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically it would threaten the security of middle - aged housewives with no job skills . They could no longer count on alimony or Social Security . Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and that women 's colleges would have to admit men .

Furthermore , the government shifted responsibility for crop transport to the private sector . Subsidies for production inputs ( fertilizers , insecticides , fungicides , and equipment ) were removed , and there was a measure of privatization of the processing sector through at least one joint venture .

      "text": "Women 's empowerment is the process in which women expand and recreate what it is that they can be , do , and accomplish in a circumstance that they previously were denied . Alternatively , it is the process for women to redefine gender roles that allows for them to acquire the ability to choose between known alternatives whom have otherwise been restricted from such an ability . There are several principles defining women 's empowerment such as , for one to be empowered , they must come from a position of disempowerment . Furthermore , one must acquire empowerment themselves rather than have it given to them by an external party . Other studies have found that empowerment definitions entail people having the capability to make important decisions in their lives while also being able to act on them . Lastly , empowerment and disempowerment is relative to other at a previous time ; therefore , empowerment is a process , not a product .",

The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona , in the Sonoran Desert .

      "text": "In March 1970 , the U.S. recommended that all NATO forces adopt the 5.56 \u00d7 45mm cartridge . This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military 's long - held position about caliber size . By the middle of the 1970s , other armies were looking at assault rifle type weapons . A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977 . The U.S. offered the 5.56 \u00d7 45mm M193 round , but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor . In the end the Belgian 5.56 \u00d7 45mm SS109 round was chosen ( STANAG 4172 ) in October 1980 . The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger , heavier , 62 grain bullet design , with better long range performance and improved penetration ( specifically , to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters ) .",

He is a Bird of bad moral Character . He does not get his Living honestly . You may have seen him perched on some dead Tree near the River , where , too lazy to fish for himself , he watches the Labour of the Fishing Hawk ( osprey ) ; and when that diligent Bird has at length taken a Fish , and is bearing it to his Nest for the Support of his Mate and young Ones , the Bald Eagle pursues him and takes it from him . With all this Injustice , he is never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping & Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy . Besides he is a rank Coward : The little King Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the District . He is therefore by no means a proper Emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our Country ... I am on this account not displeased that the Figure is not known as a Bald Eagle , but looks more like a Turkey . For in Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird , and withal a true original Native of America ... He is besides , though a little vain & silly , a Bird of Courage , and would not hesitate to attack a Grenadier of the British Guards who should presume to invade his Farm Yard with a red Coat on .

Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market . The cotton gin thus `` transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe 's first agricultural powerhouse '' . An",

The former consist mainly of plagioclase , leucite and augite , while the latter contain olivine in addition . The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals , both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass . It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines . The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase , being usually a variety of labradorite ; orthoclase is scarce . The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character , being green , brown or violet ( suggesting high Na and Ti content ) , but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine - augite or aegirine . Among the accessory minerals biotite , brown hornblende , hauyne , iron oxides and apatite are the commonest ; melanite and nepheline may also occur . The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass . The leucite - tephrites and leucite - basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks . They are black or ashy - grey in color , often vesicular , and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite . Their black augite and yellow green olivine are also easily observed in hand specimens . From Volcan Ello , Sardinia and Roccamonfina similar rocks are obtained ; they occur also in Bohemia , in Java , Celebes , Kilimanjaro ( Africa ) and near Trebizond in Asia Minor .",

Climate , with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot . Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough , for their local consumption , while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods . It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns . In the most intensive situation , farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies . Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia , such as in The Philippines . They may also intensify by using manure , artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer . Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south , southwest , and east Asia .",

Often this happens because the usable chemical energy is so deep into the center that air ( specifically oxygen ) does not reach it , therefore not causing combustion ( carbon - based fuel + O \u2192 CO + H O + C + other chemicals involved ) . It continues to stay hot and does not lose its thermal energy quickly because combustion is still happening at a low level . The small yellow , orange and red lights often seen among the embers are actually combustion . There just is not enough combustion happening at one time to create a flame . Once the embers are completely ' burned through ' , they are not carbon as is commonly believed ( carbon burns , and is not normally left behind ) , but rather various other oxidized minerals like calcium and phosphorus . At that point they are normally called ashes . See : Wood ash for more on the residue that is left .",

The overlying Ventersdorp lavas and the Transvaal Supergroup which were laid down between 700 and 80 million years before the meteorite strike , were similarly distorted by the formation of the 300 km wide crater . These rocks form partial concentric rings round the crater center today , with the oldest , the Witwatersrand rocks , forming a semicircle 25 km from the center . Since the Witwatersrand rocks consist of several layers of very hard , erosion resistant sediments ( e.g. quartzites and banded ironstones ) , they form the prominent arc of hills that can be seen to the NW of the crater center in the satellite picture above . The Witwatersrand rocks are followed , in succession , by the Ventersdorp lavas at a distance of about 35 km from the center , and the Transvaal Supergroup , consisting of a narrow band of the Ghaap Dolomite rocks and the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks , which together form a 25 -- 30 km wide band beyond that . From about halfway through the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks around the crater center , the order of the rocks is reversed . Moving outwards towards where the crater rim used to be , the Ghaap Dolomite group resurfaces at 60 km from the center , followed by an arc of Ventersdorp lavas , beyond which , at between 80 and 120 km from the center , the Witwatersrand rocks re-emerge to form an interrupted arc of outcrops today , of which the Johannesburg group is the most famous , because it was here that gold was discovered in 1886 . It is thus possible that if it had not been for the Vredefort impact this gold would never have been discovered .",

In the 1860s , French engineers experimented with using built - up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames . These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls . The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses .",

The two parties planned to determine a power - sharing arrangement between Hindus and Muslims to prevent a communal dispute . The Congress , under Gandhi and Nehru , wanted to obtain a strong central government , with more powers than state governments . The All India Muslim League , under Jinnah , initially wanted to keep India united but with political safeguards provided to Muslims like parity in the legislatures because of the wide belief of Muslims that the British Raj was simply going to be turned into a Hindu Raj once the British departed , and since the Muslim League regarded itself as the sole spokesman party of Indian Muslims , it was incumbent upon it to take the matter up with the Crown . However , in the 1940 Lahore session of the Muslim League , Jinnah endorsed partition via the two nation theory of a West and East Pakistan , painting recent developments ( 1937 provincial election , refusal of Congress to recognise the League as the sole mouthpiece of Muslims in India , etc . ) as a sign of assured enmity from Hindus , culminating in the Lahore Resolution , also known as the Pakistan Resolution . After initial dialogue , the Mission proposed its plan over the composition of the new government on 16 May 1946 . In its proposals , the creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan was rejected .",

The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems . Minis were designed for control , instrumentation , human interaction , and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping . Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) for final end use application .

      "text": "Using such a technique , in 1994 Walter Gehring found that the pax - 6 gene , vital for forming the eyes of fruit flies , exactly matches an eye - forming gene in mice and humans . The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals , such as squid , a cephalopod mollusc . Biologists including Ernst Mayr had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times , as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely . For example , the fruit fly 's compound eye is made of hundreds of small lensed structures ( ommatidia ) ; the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye , and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the retina , so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina , so the structure is effectively `` upside - down '' ; in contrast , the cephalopod eye has the retina , then a layer of nerve fibres , then the wall of the eye `` the right way around '' . The evidence of pax - 6 , however , was that the same genes controlled the development of the eyes of all these animals , suggesting that they all evolved from a common ancestor . Ancient genes had been conserved through millions of years of evolution to create dissimilar structures for similar functions , demonstrating deep homology between structures once thought to be purely analogous . This has caused a radical revision of the meaning of homology in evolutionary biology .",

Some of the most famous of these penny part - stories were The String of Pearls : A Romance ( introducing Sweeney Todd , `` the Demon Barber of Fleet Street '' ) , The Mysteries of London ( inspired by the French serial The Mysteries of Paris ) , and Varney the Vampire ( 1845 -- 47 ) . Varney is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney , and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences -- it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire . Highwaymen were popular heroes ; Black Bess or the Knight of the Road , outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real - life English highwayman Dick Turpin , continued for 254 episodes . Other serials were thinly - disguised plagiarisms of popular contemporary literature . The publisher Edward Lloyd , for instance , published a number of penny serials derived from the works of Charles Dickens entitled Oliver Twiss , Nickelas Nicklebery , and Martin Guzzlewit .",

Despite Colorado 's dramatic growth during the second half of the 20th century ( especially in the Denver area ) , it remained the sole area code in Colorado for over 40 years . By the late 1980s , an impending number shortage made a split necessary . On March 5 , 1988 , southeastern Colorado , including Colorado Springs and Pueblo , became area code 719 . The northeastern and western portions of area code 303 , including Fort Collins , Grand Junction , Vail and Aspen , switched to area code 970 on April 2 , 1995 , reducing 303 to cover Denver and the Front Range .

'' John Austin 's utilitarian answer was that law is `` commands , backed by threat of sanctions , from a sovereign , to whom people have a habit of obedience '' . Natural lawyers on the other side , such as Jean - Jacques Rousseau , argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature . The concept of `` natural law '' emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice , and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas , notably his Treatise on Law .",

Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King Charles I of England and the outbreak of the English Civil War . In the early stages of that conflict , the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King . Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies , and two of them , the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett , took control of the colonial government in St. Mary 's City in 1652 . In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen , Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion . Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony 's Protestants , and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly . This time , it would last more than thirty years , until 1692 .",

Some mention substantial gifts to the temple . A Chola king , for example , presented the temple with a golden serpent couch . Some historians identify this king with Rajamahendra Chola . The temple has witnessed and played a key role in the early Sri Vaishnavism history , particularly the centuries that followed the major Hindu philosopher Ramanuja ( 1017 -- 1137 AD ) , and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya. . It witnessed the debate between the Dvaita ( dualistic ) and Advaita ( nondualistic ) sub-traditions within Vaishnavism . Centuries later , it was a key site in the debate and disagreements between the northern Tamil and southern Tamil traditions , also called as the Vadakalai and Thenkalai . The early rulers such as the Pallavas , Cholas and Pandiyas supported it as a hub of the Bhakti movement with a devotional singing and dance tradition , but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later .",

Black smokers are formed in fields hundreds of meters wide when superheated water from below Earth 's crust comes through the ocean floor ( water may attain temperatures above 400 \u00b0 C ) . This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust , most notably sulfides . When it comes in contact with cold ocean water , many minerals precipitate , forming a black , chimney - like structure around each vent .

This would considerably lessen the shipping distances for goods going to ports on the Gulf of Mexico for products leaving the Cumberland Valley . This was completed in the 1960s and the resulting impoundment was referred to as Lake Barkley , after Alben W. Barkley , a Kentuckian who had served as Vice President under President Harry S. Truman . The plan called for a new dam and the evacuation of the entire former `` Between the Rivers '' area , not all of which was to be flooded . The area was to become Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area -- a TVA experiment designed to show a multiple - use approach to recreational lands . Unlike a national park , there were to be areas where hunting would be allowed . Over time , many other attractions were to be developed , such as a bison range , and a recreated 1850 - style farm called `` The Homeplace '' , complete with an on - site staff simulating life on the farm in period costume and working it using period agricultural techniques .

He fought for Aerys II during Robert 's Rebellion and was sent to the Wall as punishment . He is a bitter , cruel , fanatical and hardened man but knows firsthand what it is like to serve in the Night 's Watch during the winter . The previous winter , he was caught north of the Wall on a ranging mission and he and the other members of his party were forced to eat the rangers who died in order to survive . Thorne returns in Season 4 , now the acting Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch following the death of Jeor Mormont , and becomes friends with Janos Slynt . He advocates Jon 's execution for his actions in season 3 , but Jon is exonerated by Maester Aemon . Thorne later notices that the people like Jon better than him , and will most likely elect Jon as the new Lord Commander , which would make him Thorne 's superior . To avoid this , Thorne , on Slynt 's suggestion , allows Jon to lead a mission to kill the Night 's Watch mutineers in the hopes that Jon will be killed in battle , though Jon survives . Out of spite , Thorne refuses Jon 's proposal to seal off Castle Black to stop the wildlings from breaching . When the wildling army arrives , Alliser grudgingly admits to Jon that he should have listened to him , but valiantly leads his men into battle . Alliser personally duels Tormund Giantsbane , but is wounded . He is last seen being taken inside Castle Black for treatment while yelling for his men to continue fighting . In season 5 , he has been healed but walks with a limp . He appears to be the leading contender for being voted the new official Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch . Though he ultimately loses to Jon Snow by one vote in a three - way race , he is named First Ranger by Jon , which he appears to appreciate . When Jon sentences Slynt to execution for insubordination , Thorne briefly blocks Eddison Tollett 's way , but quickly abandons Slynt to his fate . After Jon 's return from Hardhome , he eventually opens the gate for the incoming wildling refugees , showing deep resentment for the new Lord Commander 's ambition to forge an alliance with the wildling tribes . After Davos ' return to the Wall , Alliser dispatches Olly with word of Benjen Stark 's current state ; the ploy is soon uncovered as a mutiny , wherein a disarmed Jon is trapped and stabbed to death . Alliser delivers the first blow , under the call `` For the Watch ! '' and leaves the Lord Commander dying in the snow . Thorne assumes command once again , but only until Edd brings back the wildlings to save Jon 's loyalists from death . Thorne is arrested for his treachery , and after Jon is resurrected , he is hanged for treason .",

      "text": "High costs may also be a factor and research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology , in Belgium , claimed a much lower cost methodology ( about 90 % reduction ) with similar efficacy , which may be suitable for some fertility treatment . At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) in Cairo , the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare . Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention . The lack of fertility treatment is problematic , and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them .",

Pikaia is a genus that appeared about 530 Ma during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life . Pikaia gracilens ( pictured ) is a transitional fossil between invertebrates and vertebrates , and may be the earliest known chordate . In this sense it may have been the original ancestor of fishes . It was a primitive creature with no evidence of eyes , without a well defined head , and less than 2 inches ( 5 centimetres ) long . Pikaia was a sideways - flattened , leaf - shaped animal that swam by throwing its body into a series of S - shaped , zig - zag curves , similar to movement of snakes . Fish inherited the same swimming movement , but they generally have stiffer backbones . It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages , which may be linked to gill slits , on either side of its head . Pikaia shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates . The flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks , seen as faint vertical lines . The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail .",

      "text": "When the Spanish Civil War erupted in 1936 , the United States remained neutral and banned arms sales to either side . This was in line with both American neutrality policies , and with a Europe - wide agreement to not sell arms for use in the Spanish war lest it escalate into a world war . Congress endorsed the embargo by a near - unanimous vote . Only armaments were embargoed ; American companies could sell oil and supplies to both sides . Roosevelt quietly favored the left - wing Republican ( or `` Loyalist '' ) government , but intense pressure by American Catholics forced him to maintain a policy of neutrality . The Catholics were outraged by the systematic torture , rape and execution of priests , bishops , and nuns by anarchist elements of the Loyalist coalition . This successful pressure on Roosevelt was one of the handful of foreign policy successes notched by Catholic pressures on the White House in the 20th century . Germany and Italy provided munitions , and air support , and troops to the Nationalists , led by Francisco Franco . The Soviet Union provided aid to the Loyalist government , and mobilized thousands of volunteers to fight , including several hundred from the United States in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion . All along the Spanish military forces supported the nationalists , and they steadily pushed the government forces back . By 1938 , however , Roosevelt was planning to secretly send American warplanes through France to the desperate Loyalists . His senior diplomats warned that this would worsen the European crisis , so Roosevelt desisted .",

      "text": "When a contract is formed , good consideration is needed , and so a gratuitous promise is not binding . That said , while consideration must be of sufficient value in the law 's eyes , it need not reflect an adequate price . Proverbially , one may sell a house for as little as a peppercorn , even if the seller `` does not like pepper and will throw away the corn . '' This means the courts do not generally enquire into the fairness of the exchange , unless there is statutory regulation or ( in specific contexts such as for consumers , employment , or tenancies ) there are two parties of unequal bargaining power . Another difficulty is that consideration for a deal was said not to exist if the thing given was an act done before the promise , such as promising to pay off a loan for money already used to educate a girl . In this situation the courts have long shown themselves willing to hold that the thing done was implicitly relying on the expectation of a reward . More significant problems arise where parties to a contract wish to vary its terms . The old rule , predating the development of the protections in the law of economic duress , was that if one side merely promises to perform a duty which she had already undertaken in return for a higher price , there is no contract . However , in the leading case of Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls ( Contractors ) Ltd , the Court of Appeal held that it would be more ready to construe someone performing essentially what they were bound to do before as giving consideration for the new deal if they conferred a `` practical benefit '' on the other side . So , when Williams , a carpenter , was promised by Roffey Bros , the builders , more money to complete work on time , it was held that because Roffey Bros would avoid having to pay a penalty clause for late completion of its own contract , would potentially avoid the expense of litigation and had a slightly more sensible mechanism for payments , these were enough . Speaking of consideration , Russell LJ stated that , `` courts nowadays should be more ready to find its existence ... where the bargaining powers are not unequal and where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties . '' In other words , in the context of contractual variations , the definition of consideration has been watered down . However , in one situation the `` practical benefit '' analysis can not be invoked , namely where the agreed variation is to reduce debt repayments . In Foakes v Beer , the House of Lords held that even though Mrs Beer promised Mr Foakes he could pay back \u00a3 2090 19 s by instalment and without interest , she could subsequently change her mind and demand the whole sum . Despite Lord Blackburn registering a note of dissent in that case and other doubts , the Court of Appeal held in Re Selectmove Ltd , that it was bound by the precedent of the Lords and could not deploy the `` practical benefit '' reasoning of Williams for any debt repayment cases .",

They do n't necessarily understand it or they feel that the balance will swing too far to something esoteric , and we could never come to an agreement on the right balance for that type of thing . Ultimately it made more sense for them to find a director that was gon na fulfill their idea of the film that they wanted , and we just sort of parted ways .

Some research suggests that knocking on doors can increase turnout by as much as 10 % and phone calls by as much as 4 % . One study suggests that lawn signs increase vote share by 1.7 percentage points . A review of more than 200 get - out - the - vote experiments finds that The most effective tactics are personal : Door - to - door canvassing increases turnout by an average of about 2.5 percentage points ; volunteer phone calls raise it by about 1.9 points , compared to 1.0 points for calls from commercial phone banks ; automated phone messages are ineffective . Each field office that the Obama campaign opened in 2012 gave him approximately a 0.3 % greater vote share . The Obama 2008 campaign 's use of field most offices has been credited as crucial in winning Indiana and North Carolina .

What drew me to the mode article ( and to the section on mode , mean , and median ) was a basic exercise from my daughter 's sixth grade math text that elicits answers regarding these three particular concepts . The exercise in her homework does not discuss the concept of `` average '' or use `` mean '' interchangeably with the former term . Additionally , from a layman 's perspective , the concepts of `` mean '' or `` average '' , `` mode , '' and `` median '' are distinct concepts , not just different flavors of `` average , '' and the most common use of `` average '' does not encompass either `` mode '' or `` median '' . Otherwise , there would be confusion as to what , for example , the `` average age '' of a given population group was ( i.e. , is it the `` mode , '' `` median , '' or `` mean '' ? ) . A more in - depth treatment of the subtle differences between various `` tendencies '' is best addressed elsewhere ; the topic 's breath is somewhat greater than what most people will be searching for . -- Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.34. 165.94 ( talk ) 02 : 44 , 26 August 2008 ( UTC )",

      "text": "A sovereign or head of state who functions as the nominal or legal and constitutional holder of executive power , and holds numerous reserve powers , but whose daily duties mainly consist of performing ceremonial functions . Examples include Queen Elizabeth II , the governors - general in Commonwealth realms , or the presidents of many countries , and state or provincial governors in federal systems . Exceptions to this are Ireland and Israel , whose presidents are de jure and de facto ceremonial , and the latter possesses no reserve powers whatsoever . A head of government ( or head of the executive ) , known as the prime minister ( PM ) , premier , or first minister . While the head of state appoints the head of government , constitutional convention suggests that a majority of elected Members of Parliament must support the person appointed . If more than half of elected parliamentarians belong to the same political party , then the parliamentary leader of that party typically is appointed . An exception to this was Israel , in which direct prime - ministerial elections were made in 1996 , 1999 and 2001 . An executive branch led by the head of government usually made up of members of the legislature with the senior members of the executive in a cabinet adhering to the principle of cabinet collective responsibility ; such members execute executive authority on behalf of the nominal or theoretical executive authority . An independent , non-partisan civil service which advises on , and implements , decisions of those ministers . Civil servants hold permanent appointments and can expect merit - based selection processes and continuity of employment when governments change . A parliamentary opposition ( in a multi-party system ) with an official Leader of the Opposition . A legislature , often bicameral , with at least one elected house -- although unicameral systems also exist ; legislative members are usually elected by district in first - past - the - post elections ( as opposed to country - wide proportional representation ) . Exceptions to this include New Zealand , which changed in 1993 to use mixed - member proportional representation ; Israel , which has always used country wide proportional representation ; and Australia , which uses preferential voting . A lower house of parliament with an ability to dismiss a government by `` withholding ( or blocking ) Supply '' ( rejecting a budget ) , passing a motion of no confidence , or defeating a confidence motion . The Westminster system enables a government to be defeated or forced into a general election independently . A parliament which can be dissolved and snap elections called at any time . Parliamentary privilege , which allows the legislature to discuss any issue it deems relevant , without fear of consequences stemming from defamatory statements or records thereof Minutes of meetings , often known as Hansard , including an ability for the legislature to strike discussion from these minutes The ability of courts to address silence or ambiguity in the parliament 's statutory law through the development of common law . Another parallel system of legal principles also exists known as equity . Exceptions to this include India , Quebec in Canada , and Scotland in the UK amongst others which mix common law with other legal systems .",

Then Washington scored three consecutive times with Jurgensen 's 4 - yard pass to Jerry Smith and 78 - yard pass to Charley Taylor , followed by a Charlie Gogolak field goal , giving them the lead , 23 - 21 . Meredith then drove the Cowboys down field to set up a one - yard touchdown run by Dan Reeves . But the Redskins matched their score on a drive ending with Jurgensen 's 18 - yard scoring pass to Taylor , making it 30 - 28 . Meredith got the ball back with no timeouts and the Redskins playing deep prevent . Somehow , he was able to drive them to the Redskins 33 . The Redskins mounted a strong pass rush to push the Cowboys out of field goal range . But apparently it was too strong . Meredith was hit just as he scrambled out of bounds . The penalty put the Cowboys on the Redskins 12 for an easy Villanueva field goal . Final : Cowboys , 31 -- Redskins , 30",

Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas , spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE . The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza . They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing , though occasionally they hunted for deer . From the remains that have been found , scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize , kidney beans , squash , cassava , hot peppers , and cotton plants , the last of which was used to make clothing . Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical , but it became showy , delicate , and big over time . They generally used red and gray colors ; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period . In its ceramics and stone works , the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works . Ca\u00f1aris",

Currently , the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team , but does require at least eight homegrown players . Greg Dyke , new chairman of the Football Association ( FA ) , wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players . His intention is clear as stated in an op - ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . Some of Dyke 's propositions include : homegrown players in a top - flight 25 - man first - team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system , and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player . Currently , to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty - one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years . This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries , even European Union boundaries , before 16 . Meaning such that , if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen , in three years time he would be nineteen .

Turning the tide against independence , these highly mobile , ferocious fighters made up a formidable military force that pushed Bol\u00edvar out of his home country once more . In 1814 , heavily reinforced Spanish forces in Venezuela lost a series of battles to Bol\u00edvar 's forces but then decisively defeated Bolivar at La Puerta on June 15 , took Caracas on July 16 , and again defeated his army at Aragua on August 18 , at a cost of 2,000 Spanish casualties out of 10,000 soldiers as well as most of the 3,000 in the rebel army .

This is an argument for the use of traps , perhaps including snares . If snares were used , the use of cords and knots which would also have been adequate for the production of bows is implied .

In another episode , the camera and cleanup crew were forced to evacuate a structurally unstable home following the 5.8 magnitude 2011 Virginia Earthquake . Twice in the series , a hoarder has kicked the crew off their property and refused further help . Lisa from season four aborted the cleanup after the first day , when her pets escaped in the process . Linda , from season nine , walked away six times , before allowing the crew to organize part of her barn ; she later told them to leave and not come back . Sandra , from season nine , no longer owned her home or horde when the episode covered her but the new owners of the home attempted to be accommodating towards her . Ultimately the vast majority of Sandra 's horde was destroyed with Sandra 's unwillingness to cooperate complicating matters . The failure to help Sandra left everyone from the psychologist involved to the homeowners heartbroken over their inability to help Sandra salvage something of her life .",

The Taft -- Hartley Act ( 1947 ) outlawed the union - only `` closed shops '' which did deprive people of the right to work , and the `` right to work '' does n't eliminate a worker 's option of joining a work or labor union . A right - to - work law simply `` gives employees the right to be free riders -- to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it '' . Under labor laws in the United States , the union as the exclusive collective bargaining agent has a duty of fair representation for all persons in the bargaining unit , including those who choose not to be members and pay dues . Thus , in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education , the Supreme Court of the United States permitted agency fees so that employees in the public sector could be required to pay for the costs of representation , even as they opted not to be a member . The right to challenge the fees must include the right to have it heard by an impartial fact finder . Freedom",

Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose , while burning biomass is carbon - neutral , air pollution is still produced . For example , the Netherlands , once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel , has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use `` may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels '' . The Netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil , to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner . Regarding biofuels from foodstuffs , the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the US would only produce 16 % of its auto fuel needs , and the decimation of Brazil 's CO absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy . Recently , alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought , such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol .",

In fact , the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945 . A very protectionist policy was adopted as soon as the presidency of George Washington by Alexander Hamilton , the first US Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795 and author of the text Report on Manufactures which called for customs barriers to allow American industrial development and to help protect infant industries , including bounties ( subsidies ) derived in part from those tariffs . This text was one of the references of the German economist Friedrich List ( 1789 -- 1846 ) . The United States has become the main opposition to free trade and this policy remained throughout the 19th century and the overall level of tariffs was very high ( close to 50 % in 1830 ) . The victory of the protectionist states of the North over the free trade southern states at the end of the Civil War ( 1861 -- 1865 ) perpetuated this trend , even during periods of free trade in Europe ( 1860 -- 1880 ) .",

During the 1950s increasingly high correlation of losses by holders of flood policies of the same company caused many insurance companies to begin excluding flood coverage from standard insurance policies , selling flood insurance separately . Over time , insurance premiums collected were insufficient in covering payouts after major flooding events . In 1968 , the National Flood Insurance Act established the National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP ) , which allows property owners to purchase insurance from the U.S. government that covers certain losses from flooding . This insurance is not set by the market risk valuation . It is less expensive than the private insurance company rate would be . This is accomplished either by the program running a deficit and borrowing money or by subsidies from the national government . Either way , the property owners with NFIP policies are receiving government subsidies to live in areas with high flood risk .",

The only way to keep them from being wasted was to boil or roast them , and begin eating them to break the fast .

Later , German Protestants retained the custom of eating colored eggs for Easter , though they did not continue the tradition of fasting . Eggs boiled with some flowers change their color , bringing the spring into the homes , and some over time added the custom of decorating the eggs . Many Christians of the Eastern Orthodox Church to this day typically dye their Easter eggs red , the color of blood , in recognition of the blood of the sacrificed Christ ( and , of the renewal of life in springtime ) . Some also use the color green , in honor of the new foliage emerging after the long - dead time of winter .

Members of the court nobility took part as performers . During the reign of Louis XIV , himself a dancer , dance became more codified . Professional dancers began to take the place of court amateurs , and ballet masters were licensed by the French government . The first ballet dance academy was the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Danse ( Royal Dance Academy ) , opened in Paris in 1661 . Shortly thereafter , the first institutionalized ballet troupe , associated with the Academy , was formed ; this troupe began as an all - male ensemble but by 1681 opened to include women as well .",

Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior , but there are some notable exceptions : Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008 , the beginning of his 4th year with the team . However , he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice , redshirted in 2008 , and returned as a captain again in 2009 . The most recent example of a `` true '' junior being named was Paul Posluszny , who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006 , his junior and senior years , respectively . The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968 , when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years . In 2014 , Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain .",

Additionally , the clavicle takes care of medial forces . In cursorial mammals ( for example the horse and other quadrupeds ) , the scapula is hanging vertically on the side of the thorax and the clavicle is absent . Therefore , in climbing animals , the serratus anterior supports the scapula against the reaction forces of the free limb and exerts high bending forces on the ribs . To sustain these forces , the ribs have a pronounced curvature and are supported by the clavicle .

The best - known surviving large sculptural work of Proto - Romanesque Europe is the life - size wooden Crucifix commissioned by Archbishop Gero of Cologne in about 960 -- 65 , apparently the prototype of what became a popular form . These were later set up on a beam below the chancel arch , known in English as a rood , from the twelfth century accompanied by figures of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist to the sides . During the 11th and 12th centuries , figurative sculpture strongly revived , and architectural reliefs are a hallmark of the later Romanesque period . Sources",

To sanctify is to literally `` set apart for particular use in a special purpose or work and to make holy or sacred .

Perhaps his most notable work is Capitalism and Underdevelopment in Latin America . Published in 1967 , it was one of the formative texts in dependency theory . In his later career he produced works such as ReOrient : Global Economy in the Asian Age and , with Barry Gills , The World System : Five Hundred Years or Five Thousand . Frank 's theories center on the idea that a nation 's economic strength , largely determined by historical circumstances -- especially geography -- dictates its global power . He is also well known for suggesting that purely export oriented solutions to development create imbalances detrimental to poor countries . Frank has made significant contributions to the world - systems theory ( which , according to him , should be rather called the World System one ) . He has argued that a World System was formed no later than in the 4th millennium BC ; his argument contrasts sharply with the scholarly majority who posit beginnings in the `` long 16th century '' ( a position held , for example , by Immanuel Wallerstein ) . Frank also insisted that the idea of numerous `` world - systems '' did not make much sense ( indeed , if there are many `` world - systems '' in the world , then they simply do not deserve to be called `` world - systems '' ) , and we should rather speak about one single World System .

Bronck became the first recorded European settler in the area now known as the Bronx and built a farm named `` Emmanus '' close to what today is the corner of Willis Avenue and 132nd Street in Mott Haven . He leased land from the Dutch West India Company on the neck of the mainland immediately north of the Dutch settlement in Harlem ( on Manhattan Island ) , and bought additional tracts from the local tribes . He eventually accumulated 500 acres ( 200 ha ) between the Harlem River and the Aquahung , which became known as Bronck 's River or the Bronx ( River ) . Dutch and English settlers referred to the area as Bronck 's Land . The American poet William Bronk was a descendant of Pieter Bronck , either Jonas Bronck 's son or his younger brother .

Because of this , the diffusion of both movable - type systems was , to some degree , limited to primarily East Asia , although various sporadic reports of movable type technology were brought back to Europe by Christian missionaries , traders and business people who were returning to Europe after having worked in China for several years and influenced the development of printing technology in Europe . Some of these medieval European accounts are still preserved in the library archives of the Vatican and Oxford University among many others . Around 1450 Johannes Gutenberg , introduced the metal movable - type printing press in Europe , along with innovations in casting the type based on a matrix and hand mould . The small number of alphabetic characters needed for European languages was an important factor .

The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product , which typically imposes an economic burden on both producers and consumers . The concept was brought to attention by the French Physiocrats , in particular Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay , who argued that the incidence of all taxation falls ultimately on landowners and is at the expense of land rent . Tax incidence is said to `` fall '' upon the group that ultimately bears the burden of , or ultimately has to pay , the tax . The key concept is that the tax incidence or tax burden does not depend on where the revenue is collected , but on the price elasticity of demand and price elasticity of supply . ",

The debris field would also be a far bigger target , stretching a mile ( 1.6 km ) or longer , whereas Titanic itself was only 90 feet ( 27 m ) wide . The search required round - the - clock towing of Argo back and forth above the sea bed , with shifts of watchers aboard the research vessel Knorr looking at the camera pictures for any sign of debris . After a week of fruitless searching , at 12.48 am on Sunday 1 September 1985 pieces of debris began to appear on Knorr 's screens .

At the base of each canal , the bony region of the canal is enlarged which opens into the utricle and has a dilated sac at one end called the osseous ampullae . Within the ampulla is a mound of hair cells and supporting cells called crista ampullaris . These hair cells have many cytoplasmic projections on the apical surface called stereocilia which are embedded in a gelatinous structure called the cupula . As the head rotates the duct moves but the endolymph lags behind owing to inertia . This deflects the cupula and bends the stereocilia within . The bending of these stereocilia alters an electric signal that is transmitted to the brain . Within approximately 10 seconds of achieving constant motion , the endolymph catches up with the movement of the duct and the cupula is no longer affected , stopping the sensation of acceleration . The specific gravity of the cupula is comparable to that of the surrounding endolymph . Consequently , the cupula is not displaced by gravity , unlike the otolithic membranes of the utricle and saccule . As with macular hair cells , hair cells of the crista ampullaris will depolarise when the stereocilia deflect towards the kinocilium . Deflection in the opposite direction results in hyperpolarisation and inhibition . In the horizontal canal , ampullopetal flow is necessary for hair - cell stimulation , whereas ampullofugal flow is necessary in the anterior and posterior canals . ",

The domestic mining industry is underdeveloped , leading to Nigeria having to import minerals that it could produce domestically , such as salt or iron ore . Rights to ownership of mineral resources is held by the Federal government of Nigeria , which grants titles to organizations to explore , mine , and sell mineral resources . Organized mining began in 1903 when the Mineral Survey of the Northern Protectorates was created by the British colonial government . A year later , the Mineral Survey of the Southern Protectorates was founded . By the 1940s , Nigeria was a major producer of tin , columbite , and coal . The discovery of oil in 1956 hurt the mineral extraction industries , as government and industry both began to focus on this new resource . The Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s led many expatriate mining experts to leave the country . Mining regulation is handled by the Ministry of Solid Minerals Development , which oversees the management of all mineral resources . Mining law is codified in the Federal Minerals and Mining Act of 1999 . Historically , Nigeria 's mining industry was monopolized by state - owned public corporations . This led to a decline in productivity in almost all mineral industries . The Obasanjo administration began a process of selling off government - owned corporations to private investors in 1999 . ",

Such and other systems and scales of measurement have been in use for some time . Research has attempted to examine the relationship between quality of life and productivity . There are many different methods of measuring quality of life in terms of health care , wealth and materialistic goods . However , it is much more difficult to measure meaningful expression of one 's desires . One way to do so is to evaluate the scope of how individuals have fulfilled their own ideals . Quality of life can simply mean happiness , the subjective state of mind . By using that mentality , citizens of a developing country appreciate more since they are content with the basic necessities of health care , education and child protection . ",

It can also occasionally be seen in the National Hockey League , which increasingly uses college hockey as a source ; the NHL Entry Draft usually drafts players during high school age ( i.e. , junior leagues ) , which allows overlooked players who excel at the college level or in European professional leagues to bypass the draft and sign directly with the NHL .

The storm crossed through the Windward Islands on the following day , passing just south of Barbados and later near Saint Vincent . Upon entering the Caribbean Sea , Harvey began to weaken due to moderate wind shear and degenerated into a tropical wave north of Colombia early on August 20 . The remnants were monitored for regeneration as it continued west - northwestward across the Caribbean and the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula , before redeveloping over the Bay of Campeche on August 23 . Harvey then began to rapidly intensify on August 24 , regaining tropical storm status and becoming a hurricane later that day . While the storm moved generally northwest , Harvey 's intensification phase stalled slightly overnight from August 24 -- 25 ; however , Harvey soon resumed strengthening and quickly became a major hurricane and attained Category 4 intensity later that day . Hours later , Harvey made landfall near Rockport , Texas , at peak intensity . Afterwards , rapid weakening ensued , and Harvey had downgraded to a tropical storm as it stalled near the coastline of the state , dropping torrential and unprecedented amounts of rainfall over the Lone Star state . On August 28 , it emerged back over the Gulf of Mexico , strengthening slightly before making a third and final landfall in Louisiana on August 29 . As Harvey drifted inland , it quickly weakened again as it became extratropical on September 1 , before dissipating two days later . ",

He defined social exchange as the exchange of activity , tangible or intangible , and more or less rewarding or costly , between at least two persons . After Homans founded the theory , other theorists continued to write about it , particularly Peter M. Blau and Richard M. Emerson , who in addition to Homans are generally thought of as the major developers of the exchange perspective within sociology . Homans ' work emphasized the individual behavior of actors in interaction with one another . Although there are various modes of exchange , Homans centered his studies on dyadic exchange . John Thibaut and Harold Kelley are recognized for focusing their studies within the theory on the psychological concepts , the dyad and small group .

The poem follows a trope in African literature of `` The White Man Laughed '' , which embodies the notion of dismay and cynical derision of the beliefs , practices , and norms of an African . However , Okara 's poem can be seen to transcend the acceptance of the derision of the White Man and present a wiser African intellectual . The poem concludes with the African teaching the White Man of his ignorance and helping him realize that the native beliefs of the African are not primitive nor removed from intellectual thought . ",

The upper layer of limestone , brownish on the exterior but a deep blue inside , was so hard and cherty it was mistaken for marble . The falls were actually three distinct formations at the head of a canyon 1.25 miles ( 2.01 km ) long , with a drop of some 50 feet ( 15 m ) through the limestone strata . The natural lake and waterfall were covered when the Colorado River was dammed with the completion of Max Starcke Dam in 1951 . A photo of the falls as they once existed can be seen at the website for the Wallace Guest House , a local bed and breakfast . Lake Marble Falls sits between Lake Lyndon B.

The cameliers participated in most of the fighting in Egypt and Palestine until the brigade was disbanded in July 1918."

Deliberate industrial production depends on neutron activation of bulk samples of the monoisotopic and mononuclidic cobalt isotope Co . Measurable quantities are also produced as a by - product of typical nuclear power plant operation and may be detected externally when leaks occur . In the latter case ( in the absence of added cobalt ) the incidentally produced Co is largely the result of multiple stages of neutron activation of iron isotopes in the reactor 's steel structures via the creation of Co precursor . The simplest case of the latter would result from the activation of Fe . Co decays by beta decay to the stable isotope nickel - 60 ( Ni ) . The activated nickel nucleus emits two gamma rays with energies of 1.17 and 1.33 MeV , hence the overall nuclear equation of the reaction is Co + n \u2192 Co \u2192 Ni + e + \u03bd + gamma rays . ",

Some species of cavy identified in the 20th century , such as C. anolaimae and C. guianae , may be domestic guinea pigs that have become feral by reintroduction into the wild . Wild cavies are found on grassy plains and occupy an ecological niche similar to that of cattle . They are social , living in the wild in small groups that consist of several females ( sows ) , a male ( boar ) , and the young ( which , in a break with the preceding porcine nomenclature , are called `` pups '' not `` piglets '' ) . They move together in groups ( herds ) eating grass or other vegetation , and do not store food . While they do not burrow themselves or build nests , they frequently seek shelter in the burrows of other animals , as well as in crevices and tunnels formed by vegetation . They tend to be most active during dawn and dusk ( crepuscular ) , when it is harder for predators to spot them . ",

The exact geographic spread of the ancient Celts is disputed ; in particular , the ways in which the Iron Age inhabitants of Great Britain and Ireland should be regarded as Celts have become a subject of controversy . According to one theory , the common root of the Celtic languages , the Proto - Celtic language , arose in the Late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of Central Europe , which flourished from around 1200 BC . According to a theory proposed in the 19th century , the first people to adopt cultural characteristics regarded as Celtic were the people of the Iron Age Hallstatt culture in central Europe ( c. 800 -- 450 BC ) , named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt , Austria . Thus this area is sometimes called the `` Celtic homeland '' . By or during the later La T\u00e8ne period ( c. 450 BC to the Roman conquest ) , this Celtic culture was supposed to have expanded by trans - cultural diffusion or migration to the British Isles ( Insular Celts ) , France and the Low Countries ( Gauls ) , Bohemia , Poland and much of Central Europe , the Iberian Peninsula ( Celtiberians , Celtici , Lusitanians and Gallaeci ) and northern Italy ( Golasecca culture and Cisalpine Gauls ) and , following the Celtic settlement of Eastern Europe beginning in 279 BC , as far east as central Anatolia ( Galatians ) in modern - day Turkey .

England had little modern literature before the 1570s , and detailed critical commentaries on modern authors did not begin to appear until the reign of Charles I . The facts about his reputation can be surmised from fragmentary evidence . He was included in some contemporary lists of leading poets , but he seems to have lacked the stature of the aristocratic Philip Sidney , who became a cult figure due to his death in battle at a young age , or of Edmund Spenser . Shakespeare 's poems were reprinted far more frequently than his plays ; but Shakespeare 's plays were written for performance by his own company , and because no law prevented rival companies from using the plays , Shakespeare 's troupe took steps to prevent his plays from being printed . That many of his plays were pirated suggests his popularity in the book market , and the regular patronage of his company by the court , culminating in 1603 when James I turned it into the `` King 's Men , '' suggests his popularity among higher stations of society . Modern plays ( as opposed to those in Latin and Greek ) were considered ephemeral and even somewhat disreputable entertainments by some contemporaries ; the new Bodleian Library explicitly refused to shelve plays . Some of Shakespeare 's plays , particularly the history plays , were reprinted frequently in cheap quarto ( i.e. pamphlet ) form ; others took decades to reach a 3rd edition . ",

Concerning the Battle of First Bull Run , the committee listened to testimony from a variety of witnesses connected with McDowell 's army . Although the committee 's report concluded that the principal cause of defeat was Patterson 's failure to prevent Johnston from reinforcing Beauregard , Patterson 's enlistment had expired a few days after the battle , and he was no longer in the service . The Northern public clamored for another scapegoat , and McDowell bore the chief blame . On 25 July 1861 , he was relieved of army command and replaced by Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan , who would soon be named general - in - chief of all the Union armies . McDowell was also present to bear significant blame for the defeat of Maj. Gen.

Much of the mountain is under water ; when measured from its oceanic base , Mauna Kea is over 10,000 m ( 33,000 ft ) tall and is the tallest mountain on Earth . Mauna Kea is about a million years old , and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago . In its current post-shield state , its lava is more viscous , resulting in a steeper profile . Late volcanism has also given it a much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes ; contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones , the decentralization of its rift zones , the glaciation on its peak , and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds .

The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba so long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward `` democratization and greater respect for human rights '' . The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba .

Prior to the Mini\u00e9 ball , bullets had to be jammed down the rifle barrel , sometimes with a mallet , and after a relatively small number of shots , gunpowder residue built up in the spiral grooves , which then had to be cleaned out .

An embargo was first imposed by the United States on sale of arms to Cuba on March 14 , 1958 , during the Fulgencio Batista regime . Again on October 19 , 1960 ( almost two years after the Batista regime was deposed by the Cuban Revolution ) the U.S. placed an embargo on exports to Cuba except for food and medicine after Cuba nationalized American - owned Cuban oil refineries without compensation . On February 7 , 1962 the embargo was extended to include almost all imports . Currently , the Cuban embargo is enforced mainly through six statutes : the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 , the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 , the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963 , the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 , the Helms -- Burton Act of 1996 , and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000 . The stated purpose of the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba as long as the Cuban government refuses to move toward `` democratization and greater respect for human rights '' . The Helms -- Burton Act further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba , and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met . In 1999 , President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba . In 2000 , Clinton authorized the sale of `` humanitarian '' U.S. products to Cuba . ",

In the spring of 542 , the plague arrived in Constantinople , working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea , later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy . Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian 's efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies , his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague .

'' Many notable landmark buildings were significantly damaged or destroyed , including the Presidential Palace , the National Assembly building , the Port - au - Prince Cathedral , and the main jail . The Ministry of Education estimated that half the nation 's 15,000 primary schools and 1,500 secondary schools were severely damaged , cracked or destroyed . In addition , the three main universities in Port - au - Prince were also severely damaged . Other affected infrastructure included telephone networks , radio station , factories , and museums . Poor infrastructure before the earthquake only made the aftermath worse . It would take half a day to make a trip of a few miles . The roads would also crisscross haphazardly due to disorganized construction . ",

Lunisolar calendars have a thirteenth month added to some years to make up for the difference between a full year ( now known to be about 365.24 days ) and a year of just twelve lunar months . The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures , at least partly due to this relationship of months to years . Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica , particularly in ancient Mayan civilization . These calendars were religiously and astronomically based , with 18 months in a year and 20 days in a month , plus five epagomenal days at the end of the year . ",

'' The hook continues this metaphor : `` So shine bright , tonight , you and I / We 're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye , so alive .

Bones of at least two dodos were found in caves at Baie du Cap that sheltered fugitive slaves and convicts in the 17th century , which would not have been easily accessible to dodos because of the high , broken terrain . The human population on Mauritius ( an area of 1,860 km or 720 sq mi ) never exceeded 50 people in the 17th century , but they introduced other animals , including dogs , pigs , cats , rats , and crab - eating macaques , which plundered dodo nests and competed for the limited food resources . At the same time , humans destroyed the forest habitat of the dodos . The impact of the introduced animals on the dodo population , especially the pigs and macaques , is today considered more severe than that of hunting . Rats were perhaps not much of a threat to the nests , since dodos would have been used to dealing with local land crabs . ",

It is based upon the following thought experiment : people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents , abilities , tastes , social class , and positions they will have within a social order . When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights , positions , and resources in the society in which they will live , this `` veil of ignorance '' prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights , positions , and resources in that society . For example , for a proposed society in which 50 % of the population is kept in slavery , it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50 % likelihood that the participant would be a slave . The idea is that parties subject to the veil of ignorance will make choices based upon moral considerations , since they will not be able to make choices based on their own self - or class - interest .

The government had to fight smuggling , which became a favorite American technique in the 18th century to circumvent the restrictions on trading with the French , Spanish , or Dutch . The goal of mercantilism was to run trade surpluses , so that gold and silver would pour into London . The government took its share through duties and taxes , with the remainder going to merchants in Britain . The government spent much of its revenue on a superb Royal Navy , which not only protected the British colonies but threatened the colonies of the other empires , and sometimes seized them . Thus the British Navy captured New Amsterdam ( New York ) in 1664 . The colonies were captive markets for British industry , and the goal was to enrich the mother country . ",

In 1884 , the French microbiologist Charles Chamberland invented a filter ( known today as the Chamberland filter or the Pasteur - Chamberland filter ) with pores smaller than bacteria . Thus , he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them . In 1892 , the Russian biologist Dmitri Ivanovsky used this filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosaic virus . His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration . Ivanovsky suggested the infection might be caused by a toxin produced by bacteria , but did not pursue the idea . At the time it was thought that all infectious agents could be retained by filters and grown on a nutrient medium -- this was part of the germ theory of disease . In 1898 , the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeated the experiments and became convinced that the filtered solution contained a new form of infectious agent . He observed that the agent multiplied only in cells that were dividing , but as his experiments did not show that it was made of particles , he called it a contagium vivum fluidum ( soluble living germ ) and re-introduced the word virus . Beijerinck maintained that viruses were liquid in nature , a theory later discredited by Wendell Stanley , who proved they were particulate . In the same year Friedrich Loeffler and Paul Frosch passed the first animal virus -- agent of foot - and - mouth disease ( aphthovirus ) -- through a similar filter . ",

The subject has an extraordinarily high turnover of staff members -- throughout the series no Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher has retained the post for more than one school year . Harry is exceptionally skilled in this subject . During the period the story takes place , the class is taught by Quirinus Quirrell ( book one ) , Gilderoy Lockhart ( book two ) , Remus Lupin ( book three ) , Bartemius Crouch Jr impersonating Alastor `` Mad - eye '' Moody ( book four ) , Dolores Umbridge ( book five ) , Severus Snape ( book six ) , and Amycus Carrow ( book seven ) .

The position had also been coveted by Snape , but he was denied the position as well . Snape was finally appointed D.A.D.A. professor in Half - Blood Prince . Rowling announced in an interview that once Voldemort had died , the jinx he placed on the office was lifted and a permanent professor had been teaching the subject between the end of Deathly Hallows and the epilogue , set nineteen years afterwards .

The purpose of the Townshend Acts was to raise revenue in the colonies to pay the salaries of governors and judges so that they would remain loyal to Great Britain , to create a more effective means of enforcing compliance with trade regulations , to punish the province of New York for failing to comply with the 1765 Quartering Act , and to establish the precedent that the British Parliament had the right to tax the colonies . The Townshend Acts ( 1767 ) were met with resistance in the colonies , prompting the occupation of Boston by British troops in 1768 , which eventually resulted in the Boston Massacre of 1770 . ",

Many have found use in traditional or modern medicine , or as starting points for drug discovery . Other alkaloids possess psychotropic ( e.g. psilocin ) and stimulant activities ( e.g. cocaine , caffeine , nicotine , theobromine ) , and have been used in entheogenic rituals or as recreational drugs . Alkaloids can be toxic too ( e.g. atropine , tubocurarine ) . Although alkaloids act on a diversity of metabolic systems in humans and other animals , they almost uniformly evoke a bitter taste . ",

Parr in college . After graduating from the University of Wisconsin , Hart and Parr developed a two - cylinder gasoline engine and set up their Hart - Parr Gasoline Engine Company in Charles City in 1897 . It was here in 1901 the term `` tractor '' with Latin roots and a combination of the words traction and power was first coined by Hart and Parr . In 1903 the firm built fifteen `` tractors '' , the first successful production - model tractor line in the U.S. The 14,000 pound No. 3 is the oldest surviving internal combustion engine tractor in the United States and is on display at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in Washington D.C. In 1929 , Hart - Parr was one of the four companies that merged to form Oliver Farm Equipment Company and finally the White Farm - New Idea Equipment Co . At its peak in the mid-1970s , the sprawling plant complex encompassed 23 acres and employed nearly 3,000 workers . The 1980s farm crisis and other economic pressures led to the closing of the plant in 1993 . As of 2013 , the vacant site stands ready for re-use . HART ",

Many of the preceding items , as well as occasional services from physicians , veterinarians , blacksmiths , and others , were often bought with barter rather than currency .

The following day , the revolutionaries began flying their own flag , clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789 . To maintain order , several bourgeois militia groups were formed . The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country . King William I rejected his son 's advice to negotiate with the rebels , forcing them towards a more radical , pro-independence stance , and sent a large military force to Brussels to suppress the insurrection .

In May 1943 , the battalion returned to Syria , and then it joined 234th Infantry Brigade in the Aegean Islands in October 1943 . Here , the bulk of the battalion was captured by the Germans on 16 November , after the Battle of Leros , with only 57 officers and men managing to escape the island . The 1st Battalion was reformed in 25th Indian Infantry Brigade , on 30 January 1944 , by amalgamating with the 8th Battalion , King 's Own . The reformed battalion , under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Richard Neville Anderson , later served in the Italian Campaign with 25th Indian Brigade for the rest of the war .",

Precise definitions and statistics vary , with some studies concluding that about \u200b \u2044 of scientists in the U.S. \u200b \u2044 are atheists , \u200b \u2044 agnostic , and \u200b \u2044 have some belief in God ( although some might be deistic , for example ) . This is in contrast to the more than roughly \u200b \u2044 of the general population that believe in some God in the United States . Other studies on scientific organizations like the AAAS show that 51 % of their scientists believe in either God or a higher power and 48 % having no religion . Belief also varies slightly by field . Two surveys on physicists , geoscientists , biologists , mathematicians , and chemists have noted that , from those specializing in these fields , physicists had lowest percentage of belief in God ( 29 % ) while chemists had highest ( 41 % ) . Other studies show that among members of the National Academy of Sciences , concerning the existence of a personal god who answers prayer , 7 % expressed belief , 72 % expressed disbelief , and 21 % were agnostic , however Eugenie Scott argued that there are methodological issues in the study , including ambiguity in the questions . A study with simplified wording to include impersonal or non-interventionist ideas of God concluded that 40 % of leading scientists in the US scientists believe in a god .",

Some double - beam instruments have two detectors ( photodiodes ) , and the sample and reference beam are measured at the same time . In other instruments , the two beams pass through a beam chopper , which blocks one beam at a time . The detector alternates between measuring the sample beam and the reference beam in synchronism with the chopper . There may also be one or more dark intervals in the chopper cycle . In this case , the measured beam intensities may be corrected by subtracting the intensity measured in the dark interval before the ratio is taken .",

Under the terms of an agreement reached between Blamey and Admiral Louis Mountbatten , the head of South East Asia Command , Australia was responsible for providing occupation forces for all of Borneo , the NEI east of Lombok ( including western New Guinea ) and the pre-war Australian and British territories in eastern New Guinea and the Solomon Islands as well as Nauru and Ocean Islands in the Pacific . The Australian forces in Borneo and the NEI were to remain in place only until they were relieved by British and Dutch units in late 1945 . I Corps was responsible for garrisoning Borneo and the eastern NEI , and the First Army disarmed Japanese forces in the pre-war British and Australian territories in and around New Guinea . After the surrender documents were signed the 7th and 9th Divisions took control of Borneo and five forces were dispatched from Morotai and Darwin to the key islands in the eastern NEI . While the British forces in the western NEI took part in fighting against Indonesian nationalists , the Australians were careful to not become involved in the Indonesian National Revolution and sought to hand control of their occupation zones to the Netherlands Indies Civil Administration as quickly as possible . Relations between the Australian troops and Indonesians were generally good , due in part to the decision by the Waterside Workers ' Federation of Australia to not load Dutch ships which were carrying military supplies bound for the NEI .

Although it was home to only about 1,000 people before c. 1050 , its population grew rapidly after that date . According to a 2007 study in Quaternary Science Reviews , `` Between AD 1050 and 1100 , Cahokia 's population increased from between 1400 and 2800 people to between 10,200 and 15,300 people '' . an estimate that applies only to a 1.8 km2 high density central occupation area . Archaeologists estimate the city 's population at between 6,000 and 40,000 at its peak , with more people living in outlying farming villages that supplied the main urban center . In the early 21st century , new residential areas were found to the west of Cahokia as a result of archeological excavations , increasing estimates of area population . If the highest population estimates are correct , Cahokia was larger than any subsequent city in the United States until the 1780s , when Philadelphia 's population grew beyond 40,000 . Moreover , according to the same population estimates , the population of 13th Century Cahokia was equal to or larger than the population of 13th Century London .",

As with British theorists , French colonial officials like F\u00e9lix Ebou\u00e9 or Robert Delavignette wrote and argued throughout the first half of the 20th century for a distinct French style of rule that was centralized , uniform , and aimed at assimilating colonial subjects into the French polity . French rule , sometimes labeled Jacobin , was said in these writings to be based on the twin ideologies of the centralized unitary French government of the Metropole , with the French colonial ideology of Assimilation . Colonial Assimilation argued that French law and citizenship was based on universal values that came from the French Revolution . Mirroring French domestic citizenship law , French colonial law allowed for anyone who could prove themselves culturally French ( the `` \u00c9volu\u00e9s '' ) to become equal French citizens . In French West Africa , only parts of the Senegalese `` Four Communes '' ever extended French citizenship outside a few educated African elite . This was contrasted with British Indirect Rule , which never foresaw subject Protectorates becoming legally assimilated into `` the home nations '' .",

The term glide is newer than semivowel , being used to indicate an essential quality of sounds such as / w / and / j / , which is the movement ( or glide ) from their initial position ( / u / and / i / , respectively ) to a following vowel .",

'' , and later posted a behind - the - scenes picture on his own Instagram , captioned : `` Finished ! It 's a wrap '' , to which Lovato replied : `` Hola Fonsi '' . On November 1 , 2017 , MTV News reported that the collaboration will be titled `` \u00c9chame la Culpa '' , a song Fonsi has been performing solo during live shows across the summer . In an interview with Billboard at iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina in Miami , Fonsi admitted : `` It 's a fun song , a fun record , we already filmed the video . '' He also revealed that the song would premiere in two weeks . In a clip shared by Billboard on November 13 , 2017 , Lovato and Fonsi can be seen meeting each other via a FaceTime call to discuss details about their collaboration . On November 14 , 2017 , Lovato took to social media to announce the release date , along with a snippet of the song featuring only her part , as Fonsi posted a shot of himself lying in bed with pillows covered in the song 's title . On November 17 , 2017 , Fonsi published a photo of a truck with him and Lovato on it , as well as short quotes including `` \u00bf Qu\u00e9 pasa Demi ? '' ( English : What 's up Demi ? ) and `` Hey Fonsi '' . Fonsi told Viva Latino : `` The lyrics are very joyful . It 's that play on words , that famous clich\u00e9 of ' It 's not you , it 's me ' that many of us have used . ''",

From the Reagan administration to the present , however , the process has taken much longer . According to the Congressional Research Service , the average number of days from nomination to final Senate vote since 1975 is 67 days ( 2.2 months ) , while the median is 71 days ( or 2.3 months ) . Some believe this is because Congress sees Justices as playing a more political role than in the past . The perceived politicization of the process has drawn criticism . For example , columnist George F. Will termed the defeat of Robert Bork 's nomination `` unjust '' and , more generally , that the nomination process does `` not delve deeply into the nominee 's jurisprudential thinking . '' Supreme Court nominations have caused media speculation about whether the judge leans to the left , middle , or right . One indication of the politicized selection process is how much time each nominee spends being questioned under the glare of media coverage ; before 1925 , nominees were never questioned ; after 1955 , every nominee has been required to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answer questions ; and the hours spent being grilled have lengthened from single digits ( before 1980 ) to double digits today . Another example of the politicization of the process was the Merrick Garland Supreme Court nomination , which remained before the Senate far longer than any other nominee .",

Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population , Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria in September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi as head of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932 . During the Sino - Japanese War ( 1937 -- 1945 ) , the loss of Manchuria , and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries , was a blow to the Kuomintang economy . The League of Nations , established at the end of World War I , was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance . After 1940 , conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control . The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations , administrative reforms , and the land - and tax - reform measures favoring the peasants -- while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence .

Her The Face of the Deep is a meditation upon the Apocalypse . In her view , what Revelation has to teach is patience . Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows . Her book , which is largely written in prose , frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation , much like Revelation itself . The relevance of John 's visions belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation . Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning . `` That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination . Winter that returns not to spring ... -- who can bear it ? '' She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John 's message . `` A few are charged to do judgment ; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy . '' Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as `` representative of all his brethren '' so they should `` hope as he hoped , love as he loved . ''",

An avalanche would have left certain patterns and debris distributed over a wide area . The bodies found within ten days of the event were covered with a very shallow layer of snow and , had there been an avalanche of sufficient strength to sweep away the second party , these bodies would have been swept away as well ; this would have caused more serious and different injuries in the process and would have damaged the tree line . Over 100 expeditions to the region were held since the incident , and none of them ever reported conditions that might create an avalanche . A study of the area using up - to - date terrain - related physics revealed that the location was entirely unlikely for such an avalanche to have occurred . The `` dangerous conditions '' found in another nearby area ( which had significantly steeper slopes and cornices ) were observed in April and May when the snowfalls of winter were melting . During February , when the incident occurred , there were no such conditions . An analysis of the terrain , the slope and the incline indicates that even if there could have been a very specific avalanche that circumvents the other criticisms , its trajectory would have bypassed the tent . It had collapsed laterally but not horizontally . Dyatlov was an experienced skier and the much older Alexander Zolotaryov was studying for his Masters Certificate in ski instruction and mountain hiking . Neither of these two men would have been likely to camp anywhere in the path of a potential avalanche .",

While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority , the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely . Former Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie , Dunnie Richard Tuck , Donald Raymond McClarren , and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity . North Korea did not respond to the suit . In December 2008 , U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy , Jr. in Washington , D.C. awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages , describing their ill treatment by North Korea as `` extensive and shocking .

Early on , Komarov 's craft lacked sufficient electrical power because only one of two solar panels had deployed . Then the automatic attitude control system began malfunctioning and eventually failed completely , resulting in the craft spinning wildly . Komarov was able to stop the spin with the manual system , which was only partially effective . The flight controllers aborted his mission after only one day . During the emergency re-entry , a fault in the landing parachute system caused the primary chute to fail , and the reserve chute became tangled with the drogue chute ; Komarov was killed on impact .

In the same way after the United States threw its weight behind Ngo Dinh Diem , who became South Vietnam 's president in 1955 , journals in the United States ignored the new leader 's despotic tendencies and instead highlighted his anticommunism . The death of civilians in a coup against President Diem at the end of 1960 started to change how Vietnam was viewed by the media . As a result , the New York Times sent the first reporter to Saigon , the capital of South Vietnam . This was followed by other journalists arriving from Reuters , AFP , Time and Newsweek . The basic policy governing how the US mission in Saigon handled these reporters reflected the way the administration of President John F. Kennedy conceived of the American role in the war . Under that framework , the Americans ' role in South Vietnam was only to render advice and support in that nation 's war against the Communists .",

Never before seen clips were shown of New York 's reaction to Tango 's proposal . He then went to get his `` mother - in - law '' while she still was confused and requested a drink . In an attempt to not tell her mother about the engagement , she hid the ring in her mouth . Sister Patterson found the ring and said it was too small . Tango became upset after watching the show and the comments New York made about his mother being too plain and overweight . He broke up with New York on stage , declaring that he originally came on the show to get to know Tiffany , the person ; however , he received the notorious persona of `` New York , '' which he had always dreaded . New York attempted to attack him and then made insulting comments about his appearance and physical assets , specifically calling him out on his inadequate penis size . She then cried onstage and said that she will not let it hurt her . She then told Chance that she should have chose him . La La comforted her by asking if she really wanted to be with someone like Tango . La La then ask New York if she knew in advance about Tango 's decision to end the relationship to which New York replied `` No '' . It was later revealed on VH1 's website that Tango had already forgiven New York , before the reunion , for her remarks about his mother ; however , the sudden angry attitude about her disrespecting his mother during the reunion show was just a plot to get himself out of the relationship he had committed to New York .",

Within two weeks 1740 new kolkhozes were established and by the end of 1950 , just 4.5 % of Latvian farmsteads remained outside the collectivized units ; about 226,900 farmsteads belonged to collectives , of which there were now around 14,700 . Rural life changed as farmers ' daily movements were dictated to by plans , decisions and quotas formulated elsewhere and delivered through an intermediate non-farming hierarchy . The new kolkhozes , especially smaller ones , were ill - equipped and poor -- at first farmers were paid once a year in kind and then in cash , but salaries were very small and at times farmers went unpaid or even ended up owing money to the kholhoz . Farmers still had small pieces of land ( not larger than 0.5 ha ) around their houses where they grew food for themselves . Along with collectivization , the government tried to uproot the custom of living in individual farmsteads by resettling people in villages . However this process failed due to lack of money since the Soviets planned to move houses as well .",

Lacking sufficient supplies to mount an attack Luxembourg was unable to prevent the Allies garrisoning Dixmude and , on 27 September 1694 , recapturing Huy , an essential preliminary to future operations against Namur . Elsewhere , de Lorge marched and manoeuvred against Baden on the Rhine with undramatic results before the campaign petered out in October ; while in Italy , the continuing problems with French finance and a complete breakdown in the supply chain prevented Catinat 's push into Piedmont . However , in Catalonia the fighting proved more eventful . On 27 May Marshal Noailles , supported by French warships , soundly defeated the Marquis of Escalona 's Spanish forces at the Battle of Torroella on the banks of the river Ter ; the French proceeded to take Palam\u00f3s on 10 June , Gerona on 29 June , and Hostalric , opening the route to Barcelona . With the Spanish King threatening to make a separate peace with France unless the Allies came to his assistance William III prepared the Anglo - Dutch fleet for action . Part of the fleet under Admiral Berkeley would remain in the north , first leading the disastrous amphibious assault on Brest on 18 June , before bombarding French coastal defences at Dieppe , Saint - Malo , Le Havre , and Calais . The remainder of the fleet under Admiral Russell was ordered to the Mediterranean , linking up with Spanish vessels off Cadiz . The Allied naval presence compelled the French fleet back to the safety of Toulon , which , in turn , forced Noailles to withdraw to the line of the Ter , harassed en route by General Trinxer\u00eda 's miquelets . By shielding Barcelona in this way the Allies kept Spain in the war for two more years . Siege",

This design featured a much larger inverted pear shaped Ceylon sapphire with a subtle cleft to resemble a heart . The chain for this necklace also featured a mix of round , pear , and marquise cut white diamonds . The bail also featured a heart cut white diamond with another round cut diamond attached to an inverted pear shape diamond which was then attached to the cage of the main stone . The necklace was donated to Sotheby 's auction house in Beverly Hills for an auction benefiting the Diana , Princess of Wales Memorial Fund and Southern California 's Aid For AIDS . It was sold to an unidentified Asprey client for $1.4 million , under the agreement that Celine Dion would wear it two nights later at the 1998 Academy Awards ceremony .

Banksy was inspired by local artists and their work was part of the larger Bristol underground scene with Nick Walker , Inkie and 3D . During this time Banksy met Bristol photographer Steve Lazarides , who began selling Banksy 's work , later becoming their agent . By 2000 Banksy had turned to the art of stencilling after realising how much less time it took to complete a work . Banksy claims they changed to stencilling while hiding from the police under a rubbish lorry , when they noticed the stencilled serial number and by employing this technique , they soon became more widely noticed for their art around Bristol and London . Banksy was the goalkeeper for the Easton Cowboys and Cowgirls football team in the 1990s , and toured with the club to Mexico in 2001 . Banksy 's first known large wall mural was The Mild Mild West painted in 1997 to cover advertising of a former solicitors ' office on Stokes Croft in Bristol . It depicts a teddy bear lobbing a Molotov cocktail at three riot police .",

Joshua went to him , and said to him , `` Are you for us , or for our adversaries ? '' `` . The Synoptic Gospels attribute the following quote to Jesus : `` Whoever is not with me is against me , and whoever does not gather with me scatters '' ( Matthew 12 : 30 ) , as well as its contrapositive , `` Whoever is not against us is for us '' ( Luke 9 : 50 ; Mark 9 : 40 ) . Marcus Tullius Cicero , in an oration before Julius Caesar in 46 BCE , published as Pro Ligario , made the following distinction : `` For we heard you say that we looked upon all as enemies that were not with us ; but that you looked upon all as friends that were not against you . '' Vladimir Ilyich Lenin , in a speech discussing the Chief Committee for Political Education , told the assembled delegates that `` It is with absolute frankness that we speak of this struggle of the proletariat ; each man must choose between joining our side or the other side . Any attempt to avoid taking sides in this issue must end in fiasco . '' George Orwell wrote in his 1942 essay `` Pacifism and the War '' , `` If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other . Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one . In practice , ' he that is not with me is against me ' . The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle , while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you , is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security . '' Benito Mussolini declared in speeches across fascist Italy : `` O con noi o contro di noi '' -- You 're either with us or against us . J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r , in an effort to unite Hungary after the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 , announced in December 1961 , `` those who are not against us are with us . '' Common form of Cold War terminology . On 30 September 1970 , the Milwaukee Journal quoted a police official of the Greek military junta of 1967 -- 74 as saying to his political prisoners : `` You make yourself ridiculous ( sic ) by thinking you can do anything . The word is divided in two . The Russians and the Americans , no one else . What are we ? Americans . Behind me there is the government , behind the government is NATO , behind NATO is the US . You ca n't fight us , we are Americans . '' Hillary Clinton said on September 13 , 2001 : `` Every nation has to either be with us , or against us . Those who harbor terrorists , or who finance them , are going to pay a price . '' President George W. Bush , in an address to a joint session of Congress on September 20 , 2001 said , `` Every nation , in every region , now has a decision to make . Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists . '' Vic Toews Canadian Public Safety Minister said on February 13 , 2012 : `` ... either stand with us or with the child pornographers '' in response to questions from Quebec MP Francis Scarpaleggia ( Lac - Saint - Louis ) regarding extensive Privacy Commission concerns about ' warrant-less access ' to all Canadian Internet and Cell phone accounts under the proposed legislation contained in bill C - 30 `` Protecting Children from Internet Predators Act '' introduced the following day ( February 14 , 2012 ) in the House of Commons of Canada .

At that moment , the speedster that continuously taunted him ( and the true perpetrator of the pranks on the Justice League ) reveals himself as the Reverse Flash , a speedster from the future who grew envious of Flash 's fame in the past and traveled back in time to steal Flash 's fame and purpose and plans to do the same to the rest of the Justice League . Atom , having shrunk down and followed Flash home overhears everything , but as Reverse Flash rushes off and restrains Flash , his suit short circuits , preventing him from returning to his normal size . Fortunately , Atom manages to free Flash and phone Doctor Fate in order to help the Flash regain his powers . While Flash is teleported to Doctor Fate 's residence , Atom attempts to return to the Hall of Justice to reveal Reverse Flash 's plan to his fellow Leaguers , which at his small size is much easier said than done . Meanwhile Reverse Flash is able to prevent crime and commit acts of heroism at a rate quicker than the Justice League can get to them .

Giant Bomb , GamesRadar+ , and Shacknews said it was an improvement in nearly every way over The Stick of Truth , being deeper , longer , more surprising , and polished than its predecessor . GamesRadar+ added that after twenty years , a South Park game that is as fun to play as it is to laugh along at has been created . PC Gamer called it streamlined , imaginative , and enormously entertaining ; and Electronic Gaming Monthly ( EGM ) said it would be difficult to find a more complete South Park experience that is as funny . Game Informer called it a welcome sequel , featuring both smart and immature jokes , and moments of sincerity that recall the charm of childhood in surprising ways . Slant Magazine said mechanically , it was one of the best , most accessible RPGs in a long time .",

The pandemic resulted in the deaths of an estimated 25 million ( 6th century outbreak ) to 50 million people ( two centuries of recurrence ) . The historian Procopius wrote , in Volume II of History of the Wars , of his personal encounter with the plague and the effect it had on the rising empire . In the spring of 542 , the plague arrived in Constantinople , working its way from port city to port city and spreading around the Mediterranean Sea , later migrating inland eastward into Asia Minor and west into Greece and Italy . Because the infectious disease spread inland by the transferring of merchandise through Justinian 's efforts in acquiring luxurious goods of the time and exporting supplies , his capital became the leading exporter of the bubonic plague . Procopius , in his work Secret History , declared that Justinian was a demon of an emperor who either created the plague himself or was being punished for his sinfulness .",

The single was released in May 1987 . On the US Billboard Hot 100 , the song debuted at number 51 on 13 June 1987 . After nearly 2 months on the chart , the song reached number one on 8 August 1987 , becoming the band 's second consecutive number - one hit in the United States .

On other Billboard charts , the song peaked at number 16 on the Adult Contemporary chart , and number two on the Album Rock Tracks chart .

          "text": "The highest agricultural incomes were earned by suburban units that were able to sell produce and sideline products in the nearby cities . Under the responsibility system , household incomes depended on the number of workers in each household and the household 's success in holding down production costs and in supplying goods and services to local markets . Most of the rural families with the highest incomes - the `` 10,000 - yuan households '' - were `` specialized households '' that concentrated family efforts on supplying a particular service or good . Many of these families owned their own equipment , such as trucks or specialized buildings , and operated essentially as private concerns . An increasingly important influence on rural incomes in the mid-1980s was the expansion of nonagricultural rural enterprises , often referred to as `` township enterprises . '' These were factories , construction teams , and processing operations , most of which were owned by collectives , primarily villages , towns , and townships . Some were owned by voluntary groups of families . Township enterprises were considered by the government to be the main source of employment for rural workers who were leaving agriculture because of rising productivity under the responsibility system . By the end of 1986 , township enterprises employed 21 percent of the rural labor force . The movement of rural labor into township enterprises helped to increase average rural incomes because of the higher productivity in nonagricultural jobs . In 1986 industrial workers in rural areas produced an average annual value of \u00a5 4,300 per person , compared with about \u00a5 1,000 per farmer in the same year .",

In the first , the victim has his or her arms tied behind their back ; a large rope is then tied to the wrists and passed over a pulley , beam , or a hook on the roof . The torturer pulls on this rope until the victim is hanging from the arms . Since the hands are tied behind the victim 's back , this will cause a very intense pain and possible dislocation of the arms . The full weight of the subject 's body is then supported by the extended and internally rotated shoulder sockets . While the technique shows no external injuries , it can cause long - term nerve , ligament , or tendon damage . The technique typically causes brachial plexus injury , leading to paralysis or loss of sensation in the arms .",

Robert Gordon rewrote Handler 's script , and principal photography started in November 2003 . A Series of Unfortunate Events was entirely shot using sound stages and backlots at Paramount Pictures and Downey Studios .

In those papers he described his partial differential equation that is the basic equation of quantum mechanics and bears the same relation to the mechanics of the atom as Newton 's equations of motion bear to planetary astronomy . Adopting a proposal made by Louis de Broglie in 1924 that particles of matter have a dual nature and in some situations act like waves , Schr\u00f6dinger introduced a theory describing the behaviour of such a system by a wave equation that is now known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation . The solutions to Schr\u00f6dinger 's equation , unlike the solutions to Newton 's equations , are wave functions that can only be related to the probable occurrence of physical events . The readily visualized sequence of events of the planetary orbits of Newton is , in quantum mechanics , replaced by the more abstract notion of probability . ( This aspect of the quantum theory made Schr\u00f6dinger and several other physicists profoundly unhappy , and he devoted much of his later life to formulating philosophical objections to the generally accepted interpretation of the theory that he had done so much to create . )",

The name of the band is an `` ironic jab '' at the people who called Gomez a `` wannabe scene . '' The group released their debut studio album in August 2009 , which debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 albums chart in the United States , with first - week sales of 66,000 copies . The album received a mixed reception , some critics praised the album for its `` fun '' nature , while others criticized Gomez for her vocal performance . The lead single failed to have commercial success , however the second single was successful . With heavy promotion through Disney and performances , the song had success on radio and with sales . In 2010 , Gomez starred as one of the two female leads in Ramona and Beezus , a film adaption of the children 's novel series by Beverly Cleary . The film premiered on July 23 , 2010 , and it was met with generally positive reviews . Selena Gomez & the Scene released their second studio album A Year Without Rain that same year , which debuted on the US Billboard 200 at number 4 with sales of a little over 66,000 . The album received mixed to positive reviews where some noticed that Gomez 's vocals contained the Auto - Tune effect . The record 's two singles both achieved moderate success . Having previously announced plans to launch a fashion line , Gomez launched Dream Out Loud in 2010 . The collection consisted of , and featured , bohemian dresses , floral tops , jeans , skirts , jackets , scarves and hats , all of which were made from recycled or eco-friendly materials . Gomez stated , `` With my line , I really want to give the customer options on how they can put their own looks together ( ... ) I want the pieces that can be easy to dress up or down , and the fabrics being eco-friendly and organic is super important ( ... ) Also , the tags will all have some of my inspirational quotes on them . I 'm just looking to send a good message . '' To design the actual items , Gomez teamed up with designers Tony Melillo and Sandra Campos , both of whom had previously worked with big - name fashion houses . Melillo and Campos teamed with New York - based Adjmi Apparel to manufacture the brand , which was formed by Adjmi CH Brands LLC , the holding company for the brand .",

Why not take over the Earth right there and then ? Spielberg does not provide an answer , and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this . An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer . The invaders were interested in humans as food animals . When they came here before , humans were very scarce .

Although elements of organizational intelligence collection have been a part of business for many years , the history of competitive intelligence arguably began in the U.S. in the 1970s , although the literature on the field pre-dates this time by at least several decades . In 1980 , Michael Porter published the study Competitive - Strategy : Techniques for Analyzing Industries and Competitors which is widely viewed as the foundation of modern competitive intelligence . This has since been extended most notably by the pair of Craig Fleisher and Babette Bensoussan , who through several popular books on competitive analysis have added 48 commonly applied competitive intelligence analysis techniques to the practitioner 's tool box . In 1985 , Leonard Fuld published his best selling book dedicated to competitor intelligence . However , the institutionalization of CI as a formal activity among American corporations can be traced to 1988 , when Ben and Tamar Gilad published the first organizational model of a formal corporate CI function , which was then adopted widely by US companies . The first professional certification program ( CIP ) was created in 1996 with the establishment of The Fuld - Gilad - Herring Academy of Competitive Intelligence in Cambridge , Massachusetts .",

          "text": "Wedding banquets In Chinese society , the wedding banquet is known as x\u01d0 - j\u01d0u ( \u559c\u9152 , lit . joyful wine ) , and is sometimes far more important than the actual wedding itself . There are ceremonies such as the bride presenting wines or tea to parents , spouse , and guests . In modern weddings , the bride generally picks red ( following Chinese tradition ) or white ( more Western ) for the wedding , but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquet . Traditionally , the groom is not responsible for the cost of the wedding invitation sweet treats ( often pastries ) , the banquet invitations , and the wedding itself . Wedding banquets are elaborate and consist usually of 5 - 10 courses , with ingredients such as shark fin , abalone , lobster , squab , sea cucumber , swift nests or fish roe in soup or as decoration on top of a dish to symbolize fertility , and local delicacies . Traditionally , the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride 's side and the alcohol consumed during both banquets . The wedding banquets are two separate banquets : the primary banquet is hosted once at the bride 's side , the second banquet ( smaller banquet ) at the groom 's side . While the wedding itself is often based on the couple 's choices , the wedding banquets are a gesture of thanks and appreciation , to those that have raised the bride and groom ( such as grandparents and uncles ) . It is also to ensure the relatives on each side meet the relatives on the other side . Thus out of respect for the elders , wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally , which the older generation is thought to be more comfortable with . On the night of the wedding day , there was a custom in some places for relatives or friends to banter the newlyweds . Though this seemed a little noisy , both of them dropped shyness and got familiar with each other . On the third day of the marriage , the new couple would go back to the bride 's parents ' home . They would be received with also a dinner party including relatives .",

The number of stamps given out varied with the amount of the purchase . These stamps were collected by customers and later redeemed for household gifts . The earliest of these stamps were brown in color and known as `` brown stamps '' or `` brown points '' . The relationship between a purchase and the collection of these `` brown points '' equated with doing a good thing ( supporting the local vendor ) and getting a bonus ( the valuable stamps ) . Purportedly , the collection of these `` brownie points '' eventually evolved into the modern usage . The term Browniepoints is still used as a marketing practice in business today by a New Zealand power company and also used by a gift service .",

Facilitated diffusion is a passive process : the solutes move down their concentration gradient and do not require the expenditure of cellular energy for this process . Carrier proteins and channel proteins allow for the diffusion of molecules across the cell membrane .

Social Security 's annual surpluses of tax income over expenditures are expected to fall sharply this year and to stay about constant in 2010 because of the economic recession , and to rise only briefly before declining and turning to cash flow deficits beginning in 2016 that grow as the baby boom generation retires .

Medicare 's financial status is much worse . As was true in 2008 , Medicare 's Hospital Insurance ( HI ) Trust Fund is expected to pay out more in hospital benefits and other expenditures this year than it receives in taxes and other dedicated revenues . The difference will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets . Growing annual deficits are projected to exhaust HI reserves in 2017 , after which the percentage of scheduled benefits payable from tax income would decline from 81 percent in 2017 to about 50 percent in 2035 and 30 percent in 2080 .

In the ensuing Mongol conquest of the Jin dynasty , the nomadic invaders avoided direct attacks on the Jin fortifications . Instead , when they could , the Mongols simply rode around the walls ; an effective example of this tactic is in 1211 , when they circumvented the substantial fortress in Zhangjiakou and inflicted a terrible defeat upon the Jin armies at the Battle of Yehuling . The Mongols also took advantage of lingering Liao resentment against the Jin ; the Khitan defenders of the garrisons along the Jin walls , such as those in Gubeikou , often preferred to surrender to the Mongols rather than fight them . The only major engagement of note along the main Great Wall line was at the heavily defended Juyong Pass : instead of laying siege , the Mongol general Jebe lured the defenders out into an ambush and charged in through the opened gates . In 1215 , Genghis Khan besieged , captured , and sacked the Jin capital of Yanjing ( modern - day Beijing ) . The Jin dynasty eventually collapsed following the siege of Caizhou in 1234 . Western Xia had already fallen in 1227 , and the Southern Song resisted the Mongols until 1279 .",

They argued that the amendment would eliminate the men - only draft requirement and guarantee the possibility that women would be subject to conscription and be required to have military combat roles in future wars if it were passed . Defense of traditional gender roles proved to be a useful tactic . In Illinois , supporters of Phyllis Schlafly , a conservative Republican activist from Illinois , used traditional symbols of the American housewife . They took homemade bread , jams , and apple pies to the state legislators , with the slogans , `` Preserve us from a congressional jam ; Vote against the ERA sham '' and `` I am for Mom and apple pie . '' They appealed to married women by stressing that the amendment would repeal protective laws such as alimony and eliminate the tendency for mothers to obtain custody over their children in divorce cases . It was suggested that single - sex bathrooms would be eliminated and same - sex couples would be able to get married if the amendment were passed . Traditional women started to oppose the ERA . Schlafly said the ERA was designed for the benefit of young career women and warned that if men and women had to be treated identically it would threaten the security of middle - aged housewives with no job skills . They could no longer count on alimony or Social Security . Opponents also argued that men and women were already equal enough with the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , and that women 's colleges would have to admit men . Her argument that protective laws would be lost resonated with working - class women . Phyllis",

On the second day , she had been found by some of guards of Briggs Fortress , but had managed to beat them and take their food rations . On the eighth day , she had been close to starving to death , but then had become motivated to survive . As she had learned to defend herself and live off of the wildlife , she had realized the meaning behind alchemy , saying that one is all , and all is one . However , returning after a month , it is revealed she had been talking to Silver 's older brother , Gold Steiner , who is not an alchemist but rather a hand - to - hand combat specialist .

The likelihood of the groups behaving similarly to one another ( on average ) rises with the number of subjects in each group . If the groups are essentially equivalent except for the treatment they receive , and a difference in the outcome for the groups is observed , then this constitutes evidence that the treatment is responsible for the outcome , or in other words the treatment causes the observed effect .

However , the twelve - , eight - bar , or sixteen - bar structure based on tonic , subdominant and dominant chords became the most common . Melodically , blues music is marked by the use of the lowered third and dominant seventh ( so - called blue notes ) of the associated major scale . The standard 12 - bar blues form is noted in uncorroborated oral histories as appearing communities throughout the region along the lower Mississippi River during the decade of the 1900s ( and performed in New Orleans at least since 1908 ) . One of these early sites of blues evolution was along Beale Street in Memphis , Tennessee . However , author Eileen Southern has pointed out several contrasting statements by old - time musicians . She cites Eubie Blake as saying `` Blues in Baltimore ? Why , Baltimore is the blues ! '' and Bunk Johnson as claiming that the blues was around in his childhood , in the 1880s .",

Cocobod 's role was reduced , and 40 percent of its staff , or at least 35,000 employees , were dismissed . Furthermore , the government shifted responsibility for crop transport to the private sector . Subsidies for production inputs ( fertilizers , insecticides , fungicides , and equipment ) were removed , and there was a measure of privatization of the processing sector through at least one joint venture . In addition , a new payment system known as the Akuafo Check System was introduced in 1982 at the point of purchase of dried beans . Formerly , produce buying clerks had often held back cash payments , abused funds , and paid farmers with false checks . Under the Akuafo system , a farmer was given a check signed by the produce clerk and the treasurer that he could cash at a bank of his choice .",

The High Desert is generally defined as the Mojave Desert , which extends from inland southern California into southern Nevada , and southwestern Utah . The High Desert also extends into other parts of the Northwest , such as the Red Desert in southwestern Wyoming . The High Desert is very different from the general desert lands found in Arizona , in the Sonoran Desert . This area of the desert land generally sits at a very high elevation , much higher than the normal desert land , and can receive very cold temperatures at night in the winter ( with the exception of California , southern Nevada and southwestern Utah ) , sometimes near zero degrees on very cold nights . The High Desert also receives a decent amount of snowfall in the winter ( with the exception of California , southern Nevada and southwestern Utah ) but melts very quickly . Monument",

This shift represented a change in the philosophy of the military 's long - held position about caliber size . By the middle of the 1970s , other armies were looking at assault rifle type weapons . A NATO standardization effort soon started and tests of various rounds were carried out starting in 1977 . The U.S. offered the 5.56 \u00d7 45mm M193 round , but there were concerns about its penetration in the face of the wider introduction of body armor . In the end the Belgian 5.56 \u00d7 45mm SS109 round was chosen ( STANAG 4172 ) in October 1980 . The SS109 round was based on the U.S. cartridge but included a new stronger , heavier , 62 grain bullet design , with better long range performance and improved penetration ( specifically , to consistently penetrate the side of a steel helmet at 600 meters ) .",

With all this Injustice , he is never in good Case but like those among Men who live by Sharping & Robbing he is generally poor and often very lousy . Besides he is a rank Coward : The little King Bird not bigger than a Sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the District . He is therefore by no means a proper Emblem for the brave and honest Cincinnati of America who have driven all the King birds from our Country ... I am on this account not displeased that the Figure is not known as a Bald Eagle , but looks more like a Turkey . For in Truth the Turkey is in Comparison a much more respectable Bird , and withal a true original Native of America ...

          "text": "The invention of the cotton gin caused massive growth in the production of cotton in the United States , concentrated mostly in the South . Cotton production expanded from 750,000 bales in 1830 to 2.85 million bales in 1850 . As a result , the region became even more dependent on plantations and slavery , with plantation agriculture becoming the largest sector of its economy . While it took a single slave about ten hours to separate a single pound of fiber from the seeds , a team of two or three slaves using a cotton gin could produce around fifty pounds of cotton in just one day . The number of slaves rose in concert with the increase in cotton production , increasing from around 700,000 in 1790 to around 3.2 million in 1850 . By 1860 , black slave labor from the American South was providing two - thirds of the world 's supply of cotton , and up to 80 % of the crucial British market . The cotton gin thus `` transformed cotton as a crop and the American South into the globe 's first agricultural powerhouse '' . An",

          "text": "Those leucite rocks which contain abundant essential plagioclase feldspar are known as leucite tephrites and leucite basanites . The former consist mainly of plagioclase , leucite and augite , while the latter contain olivine in addition . The leucite is often present in two sets of crystals , both porphyritic and as an ingredient of the ground mass . It is always idiomorphic with rounded outlines . The feldspar ranges from bytownite to oligoclase , being usually a variety of labradorite ; orthoclase is scarce . The augite varies a good deal in chemnistry and optical character , being green , brown or violet ( suggesting high Na and Ti content ) , but it is rarely high enough in Na and Fe to qualify as aegirine - augite or aegirine . Among the accessory minerals biotite , brown hornblende , hauyne , iron oxides and apatite are the commonest ; melanite and nepheline may also occur . The ground mass of these rocks is only occasionally rich in glass . The leucite - tephrites and leucite - basanites of Vesuvius and Somma are familiar examples of this class of rocks . They are black or ashy - grey in color , often vesicular , and may contain many large grey phenocysts of leucite .

Some species , such as the lesser nighthawk and the red - tailed tropicbird , help reduce the nest 's temperature by placing it in partial or full shade . Others , including some shorebirds , cast shade with their bodies as they stand over their eggs . Some shorebirds also soak their breast feathers with water and then sit on the eggs , providing moisture to enable evaporative cooling . Parent birds keep from overheating themselves by gular panting while they are incubating , frequently exchanging incubation duties , and standing in water when they are not incubating .",

The nineteen volume work covered French history from Charlemagne to the outbreak of the Revolution . Michelet was one of the first historians to shift the emphasis of history to the common people , rather than the leaders and institutions of the country . Another important French historian of the period was Hippolyte Taine . He was the chief theoretical influence of French naturalism , a major proponent of sociological positivism and one of the first practitioners of historicist criticism . Literary historicism as a critical movement has been said to originate with him .",

Climate , with large number of days with sunshine and fertile soils permits growing of more than one crop annually on the same plot . Farmers use their small land holdings to produce enough , for their local consumption , while remaining produce is used for exchange against other goods . It results in much more food being produced per acre compared to other subsistence patterns . In the most intensive situation , farmers may even create terraces along steep hillsides to cultivate rice paddies . Such fields are found in densely populated parts of Asia , such as in The Philippines . They may also intensify by using manure , artificial irrigation and animal waste as fertilizer . Intensive subsistence farming is prevalent in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south , southwest , and east Asia .",

Often this happens because the usable chemical energy is so deep into the center that air ( specifically oxygen ) does not reach it , therefore not causing combustion ( carbon - based fuel + O \u2192 CO + H O + C + other chemicals involved ) . It continues to stay hot and does not lose its thermal energy quickly because combustion is still happening at a low level . The small yellow , orange and red lights often seen among the embers are actually combustion . There just is not enough combustion happening at one time to create a flame . Once the embers are completely ' burned through ' , they are not carbon as is commonly believed ( carbon burns , and is not normally left behind ) , but rather various other oxidized minerals like calcium and phosphorus . At that point they are normally called ashes . See : Wood ash for more on the residue that is left .",

The overlying Ventersdorp lavas and the Transvaal Supergroup which were laid down between 700 and 80 million years before the meteorite strike , were similarly distorted by the formation of the 300 km wide crater . These rocks form partial concentric rings round the crater center today , with the oldest , the Witwatersrand rocks , forming a semicircle 25 km from the center . Since the Witwatersrand rocks consist of several layers of very hard , erosion resistant sediments ( e.g. quartzites and banded ironstones ) , they form the prominent arc of hills that can be seen to the NW of the crater center in the satellite picture above . The Witwatersrand rocks are followed , in succession , by the Ventersdorp lavas at a distance of about 35 km from the center , and the Transvaal Supergroup , consisting of a narrow band of the Ghaap Dolomite rocks and the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks , which together form a 25 -- 30 km wide band beyond that . From about halfway through the Pretoria Subgroup of rocks around the crater center , the order of the rocks is reversed . Moving outwards towards where the crater rim used to be , the Ghaap Dolomite group resurfaces at 60 km from the center , followed by an arc of Ventersdorp lavas , beyond which , at between 80 and 120 km from the center , the Witwatersrand rocks re-emerge to form an interrupted arc of outcrops today , of which the Johannesburg group is the most famous , because it was here that gold was discovered in 1886 . It is thus possible that if it had not been for the Vredefort impact this gold would never have been discovered .",

At the eleventh hour , Warner Bros. messengered an `` edited '' version of the episode to NBC headquarters in New York for broadcast . NBC was miffed that it was kept in the dark as it could have generated valuable ad revenue if it had aired promos that the episode marked the return of George Clooney . Clooney cited the fans of the show for his reason for making the cameo ( he wanted Hathaway 's and Ross 's characters to get back together , which many fans hoped for ) . Clooney reportedly only asked to be paid scale for the cameo .",

In the 1860s , French engineers experimented with using built - up plate girders made of wrought iron to construct buildings supported by internal metal frames . These frames were stronger than traditional masonry and permitted much thinner walls . The methodology was extensively described in engineering journals and was initially used to build warehouses .",

The two parties planned to determine a power - sharing arrangement between Hindus and Muslims to prevent a communal dispute . The Congress , under Gandhi and Nehru , wanted to obtain a strong central government , with more powers than state governments . The All India Muslim League , under Jinnah , initially wanted to keep India united but with political safeguards provided to Muslims like parity in the legislatures because of the wide belief of Muslims that the British Raj was simply going to be turned into a Hindu Raj once the British departed , and since the Muslim League regarded itself as the sole spokesman party of Indian Muslims , it was incumbent upon it to take the matter up with the Crown . However , in the 1940 Lahore session of the Muslim League , Jinnah endorsed partition via the two nation theory of a West and East Pakistan , painting recent developments ( 1937 provincial election , refusal of Congress to recognise the League as the sole mouthpiece of Muslims in India , etc . ) as a sign of assured enmity from Hindus , culminating in the Lahore Resolution , also known as the Pakistan Resolution . After initial dialogue , the Mission proposed its plan over the composition of the new government on 16 May 1946 . In its proposals , the creation of a separate Muslim Pakistan was rejected .",

In a 1970 survey , the New York Times suggested a consensus definition of a minicomputer as a machine costing less than US $25,000 , with an input - output device such as a teleprinter and at least four thousand words of memory , that is capable of running programs in a higher level language , such as Fortran or BASIC . The class formed a distinct group with its own software architectures and operating systems . Minis were designed for control , instrumentation , human interaction , and communication switching as distinct from calculation and record keeping . Many were sold indirectly to original equipment manufacturers ( OEMs ) for final end use application . During the two decade lifetime of the minicomputer class ( 1965 -- 1985 ) , almost 100 companies formed and only a half dozen remained .",

The same gene was quickly found in many other groups of animals , such as squid , a cephalopod mollusc . Biologists including Ernst Mayr had believed that eyes had arisen in the animal kingdom at least 40 times , as the anatomy of different types of eye varies widely . For example , the fruit fly 's compound eye is made of hundreds of small lensed structures ( ommatidia ) ; the human eye has a blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye , and the nerve fibres run over the surface of the retina , so light has to pass through a layer of nerve fibres before reaching the detector cells in the retina , so the structure is effectively `` upside - down '' ; in contrast , the cephalopod eye has the retina , then a layer of nerve fibres , then the wall of the eye `` the right way around '' . The evidence of pax - 6 , however , was that the same genes controlled the development of the eyes of all these animals , suggesting that they all evolved from a common ancestor . Ancient genes had been conserved through millions of years of evolution to create dissimilar structures for similar functions , demonstrating deep homology between structures once thought to be purely analogous . This has caused a radical revision of the meaning of homology in evolutionary biology .",

Varney is the tale of the vampire Sir Francis Varney , and introduced many of the tropes present in vampire fiction recognizable to modern audiences -- it was the first story to refer to sharpened teeth for a vampire . Highwaymen were popular heroes ; Black Bess or the Knight of the Road , outlining the largely imaginary exploits of real - life English highwayman Dick Turpin , continued for 254 episodes . Other serials were thinly - disguised plagiarisms of popular contemporary literature .

Despite Colorado 's dramatic growth during the second half of the 20th century ( especially in the Denver area ) , it remained the sole area code in Colorado for over 40 years . By the late 1980s , an impending number shortage made a split necessary . On March 5 , 1988 , southeastern Colorado , including Colorado Springs and Pueblo , became area code 719 . The northeastern and western portions of area code 303 , including Fort Collins , Grand Junction , Vail and Aspen , switched to area code 970 on April 2 , 1995 , reducing 303 to cover Denver and the Front Range .

Natural lawyers on the other side , such as Jean - Jacques Rousseau , argue that law reflects essentially moral and unchangeable laws of nature . The concept of `` natural law '' emerged in ancient Greek philosophy concurrently and in connection with the notion of justice , and re-entered the mainstream of Western culture through the writings of Thomas Aquinas , notably his Treatise on Law .",

Two years earlier the colony had been seized by Protestants following the execution of King Charles I of England and the outbreak of the English Civil War . In the early stages of that conflict , the colonial assembly of Maryland and its neighbors in Virginia had publicly declared their support for the King . Parliament appointed Protestant commissioners loyal to their cause to subdue the colonies , and two of them , the Virginian William Claiborne and Puritan leader Richard Bennett , took control of the colonial government in St. Mary 's City in 1652 . In addition to repealing the Maryland Toleration Act with the assistance of Protestant assemblymen , Claiborne and Bennett passed a new law barring Catholics from openly practicing their religion . Calvert regained control after making a deal with the colony 's Protestants , and in 1657 the Act was again passed by the colonial assembly . This time , it would last more than thirty years , until 1692 .",

The temple has witnessed and played a key role in the early Sri Vaishnavism history , particularly the centuries that followed the major Hindu philosopher Ramanuja ( 1017 -- 1137 AD ) , and his predecessors Nathamuni and Yamunacharya. . It witnessed the debate between the Dvaita ( dualistic ) and Advaita ( nondualistic ) sub-traditions within Vaishnavism . Centuries later , it was a key site in the debate and disagreements between the northern Tamil and southern Tamil traditions , also called as the Vadakalai and Thenkalai . The early rulers such as the Pallavas , Cholas and Pandiyas supported it as a hub of the Bhakti movement with a devotional singing and dance tradition , but this tradition stopped during the 14th century and was revived in a limited way much later .",

This water is rich in dissolved minerals from the crust , most notably sulfides . When it comes in contact with cold ocean water , many minerals precipitate , forming a black , chimney - like structure around each vent .

The MODFET ( modulation - doped field - effect transistor ) is a high - electron - mobility transistor using a quantum well structure formed by graded doping of the active region . The TFET ( tunnel field - effect transistor ) is based on band - to - band tunneling . The IGBT ( insulated-gate bipolar transistor ) is a device for power control . It has a structure akin to a MOSFET coupled with a bipolar - like main conduction channel . These are commonly used for the 200 -- 3000 V drain - to - source voltage range of operation . Power MOSFETs are still the device of choice for drain - to - source voltages of 1 to 200 V . The HEMT ( high - electron - mobility transistor ) , also called a HFET ( heterostructure FET ) , can be made using bandgap engineering in a ternary semiconductor such as AlGaAs . The fully depleted wide - band - gap material forms the isolation between gate and body . The ISFET ( ion - sensitive field - effect transistor ) can be used to measure ion concentrations in a solution ; when the ion concentration ( such as H , see pH electrode ) changes , the current through the transistor will change accordingly . The BioFET ( Biologically sensitive field - effect transistor ) is a class of sensors / biosensors based on ISFET technology which are utilized to detect charged molecules ; when a charged molecule is present , changes in the electrostatic field at the BioFET surface result in a measurable change in current through the transistor . These include EnFETs , ImmunoFETs , GenFETs , DNAFETs , CPFETs , BeetleFETs , and FETs based on ion - channels / protein binding . The MESFET ( metal -- semiconductor field - effect transistor ) substitutes the p -- n junction of the JFET with a Schottky barrier ; and is used in GaAs and other III - V semiconductor materials . The NOMFET is a nanoparticle organic memory field - effect transistor . The GNRFET ( graphene nanoribbon field - effect transistor ) uses a graphene nanoribbon for its channel . The VeSFET ( vertical - slit field - effect transistor ) is a square - shaped junctionless FET with a narrow slit connecting the source and drain at opposite corners . Two gates occupy the other corners , and control the current through the slit . The CNTFET ( carbon nanotube field - effect transistor ) . The OFET ( organic field - effect transistor ) uses an organic semiconductor in its channel . The DNAFET ( DNA field - effect transistor ) is a specialized FET that acts as a biosensor , by using a gate made of single - strand DNA molecules to detect matching DNA strands . The QFET ( quantum field effect transistor ) takes advantage of quantum tunneling to greatly increase the speed of transistor operation by eliminating the traditional transistor 's area of electron conduction .",

Business commentators believe this to have been a critical mistake , as Ansett 's fleet , staffing levels and infrastructure far outweighed that of Air New Zealand . Subsequently , both carriers ' profitability came under question , and foreign offers to purchase the Air New Zealand Group were considered . In September 2001 , plagued by costs it could not possibly afford , the Air New Zealand / Ansett Group neared collapse . A failed attempt at purchasing Virgin Blue was the final straw , and on 12 September , out of both time and cash , Air New Zealand placed Ansett Australia into voluntary administration , following which Ansett was forced to cease operations . Air New Zealand announced a NZ $1.425 billion operating loss .",

This would considerably lessen the shipping distances for goods going to ports on the Gulf of Mexico for products leaving the Cumberland Valley . This was completed in the 1960s and the resulting impoundment was referred to as Lake Barkley , after Alben W. Barkley , a Kentuckian who had served as Vice President under President Harry S. Truman . The plan called for a new dam and the evacuation of the entire former `` Between the Rivers '' area , not all of which was to be flooded . The area was to become Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area -- a TVA experiment designed to show a multiple - use approach to recreational lands . Unlike a national park , there were to be areas where hunting would be allowed . Over time , many other attractions were to be developed , such as a bison range , and a recreated 1850 - style farm called `` The Homeplace '' , complete with an on - site staff simulating life on the farm in period costume and working it using period agricultural techniques . ( Both of these attractions were added in the 1970s . ) The road through the Tennessee portion was renamed from State Route 49 to `` The Trace '' , which is what many roads and paths were called in pioneer times ( it is short for `` Buffalo Trace '' that many winding roads have been called since they seem to follow the winding path of buffalo or bison ) .

Dad has no mustache and has brown hair instead of blonde . Nick has blonde hair instead of brown and wears glasses . Anthony has brown hair instead of blonde . The cat , unnamed in the book , is named Timothy . Phillip Parker is white instead of black and wears no glasses . Albert Moyo is black instead of white . This special features 11 more bad things for Alexander : He opens a drawer too far , making it land on his right foot . He spills cereal on the floor while searching for a free prize . He falls off of the seat when the carpool stops by his school . His friends will not let him play Monkey in the Middle . He sings `` roll '' and `` Mary Lee '' while his class sings `` Row , Row , Row Your Boat '' . His friends tease him multiple times when he draws a picture of an invisible castle , sings his song loudly and incorrectly , skips the number 16 , gets no dessert , and explains why he refuses to play ball with them after school . His friends close the doors on him after school . He was forced by the dentist , Dr. Fields , to sit still for 30 seconds for messing around with the toothpaste , dental chair , and tray . His brothers pretend to be in pain when Alexander hops due to the elevator door closing on his foot . The shoe salesman turns down his alternate choice of sneakers ( green ones ) . He is forced by his father to sit out on the couch for a time - out for playing with the copying machine and knocking the books off his father 's desk . The special also includes 4 good things to show the audience that even a bad day can have something good in it : Alexander 's friends ask him if he wants to play ball with them before Alexander refuses . Anthony and Nick make up for what they did to Alexander while waiting for their mom to pick up the car . Mom finds Alexander 's favorite yo - yo in the closet while turning off the bedroom light . Before the end credits , Timothy ( the cat ) changes his mind and sleeps with Alexander while talking about how Mom says everybody has bad days , even in Australia . Although mentioned , the three following bad things are not shown in the special : The family has lima beans for dinner . Alexander watching kissing on TV . Alexander 's bath making the evening worse . The special also included three original songs : `` So much to do , so little time in the morning '' `` If I could be the only child '' `` I 've had a terrible , horrible , no good , very bad day ''",

He fought for Aerys II during Robert 's Rebellion and was sent to the Wall as punishment . He is a bitter , cruel , fanatical and hardened man but knows firsthand what it is like to serve in the Night 's Watch during the winter . The previous winter , he was caught north of the Wall on a ranging mission and he and the other members of his party were forced to eat the rangers who died in order to survive . Thorne returns in Season 4 , now the acting Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch following the death of Jeor Mormont , and becomes friends with Janos Slynt . He advocates Jon 's execution for his actions in season 3 , but Jon is exonerated by Maester Aemon . Thorne later notices that the people like Jon better than him , and will most likely elect Jon as the new Lord Commander , which would make him Thorne 's superior . To avoid this , Thorne , on Slynt 's suggestion , allows Jon to lead a mission to kill the Night 's Watch mutineers in the hopes that Jon will be killed in battle , though Jon survives . Out of spite , Thorne refuses Jon 's proposal to seal off Castle Black to stop the wildlings from breaching . When the wildling army arrives , Alliser grudgingly admits to Jon that he should have listened to him , but valiantly leads his men into battle . Alliser personally duels Tormund Giantsbane , but is wounded . He is last seen being taken inside Castle Black for treatment while yelling for his men to continue fighting . In season 5 , he has been healed but walks with a limp . He appears to be the leading contender for being voted the new official Lord Commander of the Night 's Watch . Though he ultimately loses to Jon Snow by one vote in a three - way race , he is named First Ranger by Jon , which he appears to appreciate . When Jon sentences Slynt to execution for insubordination , Thorne briefly blocks Eddison Tollett 's way , but quickly abandons Slynt to his fate . After Jon 's return from Hardhome , he eventually opens the gate for the incoming wildling refugees , showing deep resentment for the new Lord Commander 's ambition to forge an alliance with the wildling tribes . After Davos ' return to the Wall , Alliser dispatches Olly with word of Benjen Stark 's current state ; the ploy is soon uncovered as a mutiny , wherein a disarmed Jon is trapped and stabbed to death . Alliser delivers the first blow , under the call `` For the Watch ! '' and leaves the Lord Commander dying in the snow . Thorne assumes command once again , but only until Edd brings back the wildlings to save Jon 's loyalists from death . Thorne is arrested for his treachery , and after Jon is resurrected , he is hanged for treason .",

At the 1994 United Nations International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) in Cairo , the prevention and treatment of infertility was accepted into the program of action for reproductive healthcare . Infertility has shown to have a greater effect on developing nations than on birth rates or population control , but also on a social level as well . Reproduction is a large aspect of life for many cultures within developing nations , and infertility can lead to social and familial problems such as rejection or abandonment as well as personal psychological issues . Currently , fertility treatment options and programs are only available through private health sectors in developing nations and little - to - no treatment is available through public health sectors . The fertility treatment options offered through the private sectors are often costly or not easily accessible . Additionally , counseling is considered an essential aspect of fertility treatment , and due to lack of education and resources such forms of therapy remain scarce as well . While quality fertility care is not readily available in developing nations ( such as sub-Saharan African countries ) , a standard procedure of care could be easily implemented for a low cost as a basic intervention . The lack of fertility treatment is problematic , and high birth and population rates are every reason to implement treatment options rather than reject them .",

Pikaia is a genus that appeared about 530 Ma during the Cambrian explosion of multicellular life . Pikaia gracilens ( pictured ) is a transitional fossil between invertebrates and vertebrates , and may be the earliest known chordate . In this sense it may have been the original ancestor of fishes . It was a primitive creature with no evidence of eyes , without a well defined head , and less than 2 inches ( 5 centimetres ) long . Pikaia was a sideways - flattened , leaf - shaped animal that swam by throwing its body into a series of S - shaped , zig - zag curves , similar to movement of snakes . Fish inherited the same swimming movement , but they generally have stiffer backbones . It had a pair of large head tentacles and a series of short appendages , which may be linked to gill slits , on either side of its head . Pikaia shows the essential prerequisites for vertebrates . The flattened body is divided into pairs of segmented muscle blocks , seen as faint vertical lines . The muscles lie on either side of a flexible structure resembling a rod that runs from the tip of the head to the tip of the tail .",

This was in line with both American neutrality policies , and with a Europe - wide agreement to not sell arms for use in the Spanish war lest it escalate into a world war . Congress endorsed the embargo by a near - unanimous vote . Only armaments were embargoed ; American companies could sell oil and supplies to both sides . Roosevelt quietly favored the left - wing Republican ( or `` Loyalist '' ) government , but intense pressure by American Catholics forced him to maintain a policy of neutrality . The Catholics were outraged by the systematic torture , rape and execution of priests , bishops , and nuns by anarchist elements of the Loyalist coalition . This successful pressure on Roosevelt was one of the handful of foreign policy successes notched by Catholic pressures on the White House in the 20th century . Germany and Italy provided munitions , and air support , and troops to the Nationalists , led by Francisco Franco . The Soviet Union provided aid to the Loyalist government , and mobilized thousands of volunteers to fight , including several hundred from the United States in the Abraham Lincoln Battalion . All along the Spanish military forces supported the nationalists , and they steadily pushed the government forces back . By 1938 , however , Roosevelt was planning to secretly send American warplanes through France to the desperate Loyalists . His senior diplomats warned that this would worsen the European crisis , so Roosevelt desisted .",

A triglyph is located above the centre of each capital , and above the centre of each lintel . However , at the corners of the building , the triglyphs do not fall over the centre the column .

          "text": "When a contract is formed , good consideration is needed , and so a gratuitous promise is not binding . That said , while consideration must be of sufficient value in the law 's eyes , it need not reflect an adequate price . Proverbially , one may sell a house for as little as a peppercorn , even if the seller `` does not like pepper and will throw away the corn . '' This means the courts do not generally enquire into the fairness of the exchange , unless there is statutory regulation or ( in specific contexts such as for consumers , employment , or tenancies ) there are two parties of unequal bargaining power . Another difficulty is that consideration for a deal was said not to exist if the thing given was an act done before the promise , such as promising to pay off a loan for money already used to educate a girl . In this situation the courts have long shown themselves willing to hold that the thing done was implicitly relying on the expectation of a reward . More significant problems arise where parties to a contract wish to vary its terms . The old rule , predating the development of the protections in the law of economic duress , was that if one side merely promises to perform a duty which she had already undertaken in return for a higher price , there is no contract . However , in the leading case of Williams v Roffey Bros & Nicholls ( Contractors ) Ltd , the Court of Appeal held that it would be more ready to construe someone performing essentially what they were bound to do before as giving consideration for the new deal if they conferred a `` practical benefit '' on the other side . So , when Williams , a carpenter , was promised by Roffey Bros , the builders , more money to complete work on time , it was held that because Roffey Bros would avoid having to pay a penalty clause for late completion of its own contract , would potentially avoid the expense of litigation and had a slightly more sensible mechanism for payments , these were enough . Speaking of consideration , Russell LJ stated that , `` courts nowadays should be more ready to find its existence ... where the bargaining powers are not unequal and where the finding of consideration reflects the true intention of the parties . '' In other words , in the context of contractual variations , the definition of consideration has been watered down . However , in one situation the `` practical benefit '' analysis can not be invoked , namely where the agreed variation is to reduce debt repayments . In Foakes v Beer , the House of Lords held that even though Mrs Beer promised Mr Foakes he could pay back \u00a3 2090 19 s by instalment and without interest , she could subsequently change her mind and demand the whole sum . Despite Lord Blackburn registering a note of dissent in that case and other doubts , the Court of Appeal held in Re Selectmove Ltd , that it was bound by the precedent of the Lords and could not deploy the `` practical benefit '' reasoning of Williams for any debt repayment cases .",

Romanek 's original vision was to `` infuse a balance of cinema in a popcorn movie scenario '' , stating , `` When there 's a certain amount of money involved , these things make studios and producers a little nervous . They do n't necessarily understand it or they feel that the balance will swing too far to something esoteric , and we could never come to an agreement on the right balance for that type of thing . Ultimately it made more sense for them to find a director that was gon na fulfill their idea of the film that they wanted , and we just sort of parted ways . '' In January 2008 , Romanek left the project because of creative differences . Brett Ratner emerged as a frontrunner to replace Romanek , but the studio also met with Frank Darabont , James Mangold and Joe Johnston . They were also interested in Bill Condon , and Martin Campbell was interested . Johnston was hired to direct on 3 February 2008 , and the film 's shooting schedule and budget remained as intended . Johnston hired David Self to rewrite the script .",

Both document Christopher Columbus ' discoveries as well as that of John Cabot , including information from Portuguese sources and Marco Polo 's account . There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources . Newfoundland and Cuba are shown connected to Asia , as Columbus and Cabot believed . `` Sipganus '' ( Marco Polo 's Japan ) is identical with `` Spagnola '' ( Hispaniola ) on the Ruysch map . The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland and shows the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast and shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position . Greenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch 's map , and not Europe as earlier maps had showed . Around the north pole , Ruysch drew islands , based on reports in the book Inventio Fortunata of the English friar Nicholas of Lynne . Interestingly , the island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to Svalbard , which would not be discovered until 1597 ( by Willem Barents ) . Ruysch calls it ' European Hyberborea ' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of ' Sancti Odulfi ' , St Olaf 's church in Vard\u00f8 on the Finnmark coast .",

The American musical Show Boat ( 1927 ) opens in 1887 on a Mississippi River boat , after the Reconstruction era and imposition of racial segregation and Jim Crow in the South . Steve , a white man married to a mixed - race woman who passes as white , is pursued by a Southern sheriff . He intends to arrest Steve and charge him with miscegenation for being married to a woman of partly black ancestry . Steve pricks his wife 's finger and swallows some of her blood . When the sheriff arrives , Steve asks him whether he would consider a man to be white if he had `` negro blood '' in him . The sheriff replies that `` one drop of Negro blood makes you a Negro in these parts '' . Steve tells the sheriff that he has `` more than a drop of negro blood in me '' . After being assured by others that Steve is telling the truth , the sheriff leaves without arresting Steve .",

If factions in a two - party system are in fundamental disagreement on policy goals , or even principles , they can be slow to make policy changes , which appears to be the case now in the U.S. with power split between Democrats and Republicans . Still coalition governments struggle , sometimes for years , to change policy and often fail altogether , post World War II France and Italy being prime examples . When one party in a two - party system controls all elective branches , however , policy changes can be both swift and significant . Democrats Woodrow Wilson , Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson were beneficiaries of such fortuitous circumstances , as were Republicans as far removed in time as Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan . Barack Obama briefly had such an advantage between 2009 and 2011 . As of 2017 , President Donald Trump currently enjoys Republican control of both the house and senate .",

The constitution of the mother - city was usually adopted by the colony , but the new city remained politically independent . The `` holy fire '' of the metropolis was preserved in a special place to remind people of the common ties . If the colony sent out a fresh colony on its own account , the mother - city was generally consulted , or was at least requested to furnish a leader .

          "text": "On a more practical bent , elementary school texts are discussing the three concepts , `` mode , '' `` median , '' and `` mean '' together without even mentioning the `` average '' concept . What drew me to the mode article ( and to the section on mode , mean , and median ) was a basic exercise from my daughter 's sixth grade math text that elicits answers regarding these three particular concepts . The exercise in her homework does not discuss the concept of `` average '' or use `` mean '' interchangeably with the former term . Additionally , from a layman 's perspective , the concepts of `` mean '' or `` average '' , `` mode , '' and `` median '' are distinct concepts , not just different flavors of `` average , '' and the most common use of `` average '' does not encompass either `` mode '' or `` median '' . Otherwise , there would be confusion as to what , for example , the `` average age '' of a given population group was ( i.e. , is it the `` mode , '' `` median , '' or `` mean '' ? ) . A more in - depth treatment of the subtle differences between various `` tendencies '' is best addressed elsewhere ; the topic 's breath is somewhat greater than what most people will be searching for . -- Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.34. 165.94 ( talk ) 02 : 44 , 26 August 2008 ( UTC )",

The main character of Oates ' story is Connie , a beautiful , self - absorbed 15 - year - old girl , who is at odds with her mother -- once a beauty herself -- and with her dutiful , `` steady '' , and homely older sister . Without her parents ' knowledge , she spends most of her evenings picking up boys at a Big Boy restaurant , and one evening captures the attention of a stranger in a gold convertible covered with cryptic writing . While her parents are away at her aunt 's barbecue , two men pull up in front of Connie 's house and call her out . She recognizes the driver , Arnold Friend , as the man from the drive - in restaurant , and is initially charmed by the smooth - talking , charismatic stranger . He tells Connie he is 18 and has come to take her for a ride in his car with his sidekick Ellie . Connie slowly realizes that he is actually much older , and grows afraid . When she refuses to go with them , Friend becomes more forceful and threatening , saying that he will harm her family , while at the same time appealing to her vanity , saying that she is too good for them .

          "text": "A sovereign or head of state who functions as the nominal or legal and constitutional holder of executive power , and holds numerous reserve powers , but whose daily duties mainly consist of performing ceremonial functions . Examples include Queen Elizabeth II , the governors - general in Commonwealth realms , or the presidents of many countries , and state or provincial governors in federal systems . Exceptions to this are Ireland and Israel , whose presidents are de jure and de facto ceremonial , and the latter possesses no reserve powers whatsoever . A head of government ( or head of the executive ) , known as the prime minister ( PM ) , premier , or first minister . While the head of state appoints the head of government , constitutional convention suggests that a majority of elected Members of Parliament must support the person appointed . If more than half of elected parliamentarians belong to the same political party , then the parliamentary leader of that party typically is appointed . An exception to this was Israel , in which direct prime - ministerial elections were made in 1996 , 1999 and 2001 . An executive branch led by the head of government usually made up of members of the legislature with the senior members of the executive in a cabinet adhering to the principle of cabinet collective responsibility ; such members execute executive authority on behalf of the nominal or theoretical executive authority . An independent , non-partisan civil service which advises on , and implements , decisions of those ministers . Civil servants hold permanent appointments and can expect merit - based selection processes and continuity of employment when governments change . A parliamentary opposition ( in a multi-party system ) with an official Leader of the Opposition . A legislature , often bicameral , with at least one elected house -- although unicameral systems also exist ; legislative members are usually elected by district in first - past - the - post elections ( as opposed to country - wide proportional representation ) . Exceptions to this include New Zealand , which changed in 1993 to use mixed - member proportional representation ; Israel , which has always used country wide proportional representation ; and Australia , which uses preferential voting . A lower house of parliament with an ability to dismiss a government by `` withholding ( or blocking ) Supply '' ( rejecting a budget ) , passing a motion of no confidence , or defeating a confidence motion . The Westminster system enables a government to be defeated or forced into a general election independently . A parliament which can be dissolved and snap elections called at any time . Parliamentary privilege , which allows the legislature to discuss any issue it deems relevant , without fear of consequences stemming from defamatory statements or records thereof Minutes of meetings , often known as Hansard , including an ability for the legislature to strike discussion from these minutes The ability of courts to address silence or ambiguity in the parliament 's statutory law through the development of common law . Another parallel system of legal principles also exists known as equity . Exceptions to this include India , Quebec in Canada , and Scotland in the UK amongst others which mix common law with other legal systems .",

He continued his career in Germany as a clergyman and as a leading voice of penance and reconciliation for the German people after World War II .

Although Rick quickly adapts to the notion of killing walkers , he retains his morality towards the living , which puts him at odds with Shane . Rick 's morality is constantly tested to protect his family and friends . Over time , his morals slowly diminish after multiple conflicts with other survivors and becomes `` colder '' towards his enemies . Rick struggles to keep his humanity intact throughout the series . His moral compass is further tested by his own group when encountering non-group members who the group believe should join their community .

Their culture is among the oldest found in the Americas , spanning from 3500 to 1800 BCE . The Valdivia lived in a community of houses built in a circle or oval around a central plaza . They were sedentary people who lived off farming and fishing , though occasionally they hunted for deer . From the remains that have been found , scholars have determined that Valdivians cultivated maize , kidney beans , squash , cassava , hot peppers , and cotton plants , the last of which was used to make clothing . Valdivian pottery initially was rough and practical , but it became showy , delicate , and big over time . They generally used red and gray colors ; and the polished dark red pottery is characteristic of the Valdivia period . In its ceramics and stone works , the Valdivia culture shows a progression from the most simple to much more complicated works . Ca\u00f1aris",

The review found that the evidence was of moderate quality : few studies attempted to reduce observer bias , control for confounding factors , report variance measures , or use appropriate analysis . Although no major differences between natural and artificial fluoridation were apparent , the evidence was inadequate for a conclusion about any differences . A 2007 Australian systematic review used the same inclusion criteria as York 's , plus one additional study . This did not affect the York conclusions . A 2011 European Commission systematic review based its efficacy on York 's review conclusion . A 2015 Cochrane systematic review estimated a reduction in cavities when water fluoridation was used by children who had no access to other sources of fluoride to be 35 % in baby teeth and 26 % in permanent teeth . The evidence was of poor quality .",

Joyce found herself in Nashville 's famed Columbia Studios working with the Legendary Owen Bradley , The Jordanaires , and session players the likes of Pete Drake , Buddy Harmon , Harold Bradley , Billy Grammer and Bobby Moore . The week she recorded Leavin ' On Your Mind in Nashville at the old Columbia Studios , Patsy Cline came into Owen Bradley 's office and he played Joyce 's record for her , she immediately loved the tune and wanted to record it but Owen said no , we 'll wait and see what this Canadian girl does with it . Joyce Smith was one of only a handful to have her early records sell in excess of 100,000 copies in the U.S. which Decca said was a major hit for a first record . Joyce recorded several singles for Decca in the 60 's . Her many years of superb performances at rodeos , on TV , and live concerts around the world , and her many industry awards and accolades truly set her apart as a Country Music Legend and a first class lady . Joyce was inducted into the National Traditional Country Music Hall of Fame in the U.S in 2007 and in 2010 was inducted into the Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame . Joyce makes her home in Edmonton , Alberta Canada and still performs regularly with the Canadian Country Music Legends Show .",

The effect can be significant . For instance , according to the OECD `` the large NO emissions from ship traffic lead to significant increases in hydroxyl ( OH ) , which is the major oxidant in the lower atmosphere . Since reaction with OH is a major way of removing methane from the atmosphere , ship emissions decrease methane concentrations . ( Reductions in methane lifetimes due to shipping - based NO emissions vary between 1.5 % and 5 % in different calculations ) .

Currently , the Premier League does not have a maximum restriction on the number of foreign players allowed on a team , but does require at least eight homegrown players . Greg Dyke , new chairman of the Football Association ( FA ) , wants to implement much stronger regulation of foreign players . His intention is clear as stated in an op - ed piece so that England can win the 2022 World Cup in Qatar . Some of Dyke 's propositions include : homegrown players in a top - flight 25 - man first - team squad be increased from eight to 12 two of which must be brought up in the teams youth system , and also changing the definition of what it is to be a homegrown player . Currently , to be classified as homegrown one must be on an English team for at least three years before the age of twenty - one in which Dyke would like to reduce to eighteen years . This would mean a teenager would have to be with the club at a maximum age of fifteen and players are not allowed to move across national boundaries , even European Union boundaries , before 16 . Meaning such that , if a foreign player joined an English youth academy at sixteen , in three years time he would be nineteen . Thus said player failing to qualify as a homegrown player due to the fact he would be older than eighteen .",

This is an argument for the use of traps , perhaps including snares . If snares were used , the use of cords and knots which would also have been adequate for the production of bows is implied .

The Taft -- Hartley Act ( 1947 ) outlawed the union - only `` closed shops '' which did deprive people of the right to work , and the `` right to work '' does n't eliminate a worker 's option of joining a work or labor union . A right - to - work law simply `` gives employees the right to be free riders -- to benefit from collective bargaining without paying for it '' . Under labor laws in the United States , the union as the exclusive collective bargaining agent has a duty of fair representation for all persons in the bargaining unit , including those who choose not to be members and pay dues . Thus , in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education , the Supreme Court of the United States permitted agency fees so that employees in the public sector could be required to pay for the costs of representation , even as they opted not to be a member . The right to challenge the fees must include the right to have it heard by an impartial fact finder . Freedom",

Because of the peculiar factors ( Specie Circular ) of international trade at the time , abundant amounts of silver were coming into the United States from Mexico and China . Land sales and tariffs on imports were also generating substantial federal revenues . Through lucrative cotton exports and the marketing of state - backed bonds in British money markets , the United States acquired significant capital investment from Great Britain . These bonds financed transportation projects in the United States .

Biofuels are not inherently ecologically friendly for this purpose , while burning biomass is carbon - neutral , air pollution is still produced . For example , the Netherlands , once leader in use of palm oil as a biofuel , has suspended all subsidies for palm oil due to the scientific evidence that their use `` may sometimes create more environmental harm than fossil fuels '' . The Netherlands government and environmental groups are trying to trace the origins of imported palm oil , to certify which operations produce the oil in a responsible manner . Regarding biofuels from foodstuffs , the realization that converting the entire grain harvest of the US would only produce 16 % of its auto fuel needs , and the decimation of Brazil 's CO absorbing tropical rain forests to make way for biofuel production has made it clear that placing energy markets in competition with food markets results in higher food prices and insignificant or negative impact on energy issues such as global warming or dependence on foreign energy . Recently , alternatives to such undesirable sustainable fuels are being sought , such as commercially viable sources of cellulosic ethanol .",

The Georgian - style villa was built in 1836 . However , the expense of building the road from the beach ( no financial assistance being provided by Trinity House , despite their regular use of the road following the construction of the lighthouses ) , the villa and the general cost of running the island had a ruinous effect on the family 's finances , which had been damaged by reduced profits from their sugar plantations in Jamaica .",

In fact , the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945 . A very protectionist policy was adopted as soon as the presidency of George Washington by Alexander Hamilton , the first US Secretary of the Treasury from 1789 to 1795 and author of the text Report on Manufactures which called for customs barriers to allow American industrial development and to help protect infant industries , including bounties ( subsidies ) derived in part from those tariffs . This text was one of the references of the German economist Friedrich List ( 1789 -- 1846 ) . The United States has become the main opposition to free trade and this policy remained throughout the 19th century and the overall level of tariffs was very high ( close to 50 % in 1830 ) . The victory of the protectionist states of the North over the free trade southern states at the end of the Civil War ( 1861 -- 1865 ) perpetuated this trend , even during periods of free trade in Europe ( 1860 -- 1880 ) .",

During the 1950s increasingly high correlation of losses by holders of flood policies of the same company caused many insurance companies to begin excluding flood coverage from standard insurance policies , selling flood insurance separately . Over time , insurance premiums collected were insufficient in covering payouts after major flooding events . In 1968 , the National Flood Insurance Act established the National Flood Insurance Program ( NFIP ) , which allows property owners to purchase insurance from the U.S. government that covers certain losses from flooding . This insurance is not set by the market risk valuation . It is less expensive than the private insurance company rate would be . This is accomplished either by the program running a deficit and borrowing money or by subsidies from the national government . Either way , the property owners with NFIP policies are receiving government subsidies to live in areas with high flood risk .",

The only way to keep them from being wasted was to boil or roast them , and begin eating them to break the fast . As a special dish , they would probably have been decorated as part of the celebrations . Later , German Protestants retained the custom of eating colored eggs for Easter , though they did not continue the tradition of fasting . Eggs boiled with some flowers change their color , bringing the spring into the homes , and some over time added the custom of decorating the eggs . Many Christians of the Eastern Orthodox Church to this day typically dye their Easter eggs red , the color of blood , in recognition of the blood of the sacrificed Christ ( and , of the renewal of life in springtime ) . Some also use the color green , in honor of the new foliage emerging after the long - dead time of winter . The Ukrainian art of decorating eggs for Easter , known as pysanky , dates to ancient , pre-Christian times . Similar variants of this form of artwork are seen amongst other eastern and central European cultures .",

Other city - states were handled quite differently and were allowed a greater degree of autonomy . After Philip II conquered Amphipolis in 357 BC , the city was allowed to retain its democracy , including its constitution , popular assembly , city council ( boule ) , and yearly elections for new officials , but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner ( epistates ) to monitor the city 's political affairs . Philippi , the city founded by Philip II , was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies , since the assembly ( ecclesia ) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice . Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues . The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods .",

Two of his companies advanced on the double and opened vicious fire on the American right , and Fraser 's force threatened to turn the American left flank .

Some life - size sculpture was evidently done in stucco or plaster , but surviving examples are understandably rare . The best - known surviving large sculptural work of Proto - Romanesque Europe is the life - size wooden Crucifix commissioned by Archbishop Gero of Cologne in about 960 -- 65 , apparently the prototype of what became a popular form . These were later set up on a beam below the chancel arch , known in English as a rood , from the twelfth century accompanied by figures of the Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist to the sides . During the 11th and 12th centuries , figurative sculpture strongly revived , and architectural reliefs are a hallmark of the later Romanesque period . Sources",

In the context of seasonality, it can be used to calculate the average demand of a particular season (day, week, month, or year) by calculating the average of historical data corresponding to that season. However, it is important to note that Moving Average is a time series model that does not account for trends or seasonality explicitly. Other models such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing State Space Models are more advanced and can handle trends and seasonality in a more accurate manner. In conclusion, while Moving Average can be used to calculate seasonal indices, it is not the most suitable method for forecasting seasonal time series data.",

Based on the provided document, the Dadaists were a group of artists who rejected the logic and aestheticism of modern capitalist society in the early 20th century.

The chorus repeats the line \"I'd catch a grenade for ya,\" which symbolizes the speaker's willingness to put themselves in harm's way for the person they love, despite knowing that they don't feel the same way.

The lyrics describe a failed relationship where the protagonist gave their all to someone, but the person discarded their love. The chorus expresses a willingness to go to extreme lengths, even catching a grenade, for the person they love, while acknowledging that the other person would not do the same. Overall, the song portrays the pain and longing caused by an unreciprocated love.",

So, to reach a verdict in a criminal case, at least 12 jurors must agree in Louisiana and at least 11 jurors must agree in Oregon. If the case is for a capital crime, a unanimous verdict is required.",

During this ritual, seamen would parade a straw-stuffed effigy of a horse around the deck before throwing it overboard. The term \"dead horse\" referred to a period of time without income for the seamen, usually lasting a month or two, when they had already spent their pay in advance before a long voyage. As west-bound shipping from Europe usually reached the subtropics at about the time the \"dead horse\" debt was worked off, the latitude became associated with the ceremony, and thus became known as the Horse latitudes.",

It does this by allowing impulses to \"hop\" or propagate by saltatory conduction rather than continuously moving as waves along unmyelinated fibers. Myelin also decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane, preventing the electric current from leaving the axon. This enables efficient and rapid transmission of nerve impulses, enhancing communication within the nervous system. Additionally, myelin has been suggested to facilitate agile communication between distant body parts, allowing for the coordination of larger body size.",

This is because myelin decreases capacitance and increases electrical resistance across the cell membrane, allowing impulses to \"hop\" or propagate by saltatory conduction. This means that impulses can travel faster and more efficiently along myelinated fibers, allowing for faster communication between different parts of the body. Additionally, myelin permits larger body size by maintaining agile communication between distant body parts.",

The digit 0 initially came from the Egyptian hieroglyph representing the concept of emptiness or nothingness. The other digits evolved from various Indian and Arabic scripts that denoted numbers, with their shapes influenced by the symbols and their values. For instance, the digit 1 resembles a dot due to its earliest form as a single dot representing a unit. The digit 5 evolved from the phonetic symbol for the Arabic word for \"five,\" which sounded like the Arabic phrase for \"one above,\" implying a number greater than one. Over time, these shapes have been standardized and refined, leading to the familiar forms used in mathematics and everyday life today.",

Based on the provided document, you need to blind bake pastry when you're making a pie crust that will be filled with an unbaked filling, such as pudding or cream pies. This is because the filling may not be able to cook the crust fully, so pre-baking the crust helps to ensure that it's fully cooked and doesn't become soggy. Additionally, if the filling has a shorter bake time than the crust, blind baking is necessary to ensure that the crust is cooked through before the filling is added.",

Based on the provided document, the accounting rate of return (ARR) is a financial ratio used in capital budgeting that calculates the return generated from the net income of a proposed capital investment. It is expressed as a percentage return and represents the amount of money earned per dollar invested per year. If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return, the project is considered acceptable. If it is less than the desired rate, the project should be rejected. The higher the ARR, the more attractive the investment. According to the document, more than half of large firms use ARR when appraising projects. In this case, the ARR is 7%.",

Protecting the cell: The cell membrane serves as a physical barrier that separates the cell from its surroundings and protects it from external damage. 2. Controlling the movement of substances: The cell membrane is selectively permeable, allowing certain molecules to pass through while blocking others. This function helps maintain the internal environment of the cell and regulate the flux of ions and nutrients. 3. Involvement in various cellular processes: The cell membrane plays a role in cell adhesion, ion conductivity, and cell signalling. It also serves as the attachment surface for extracellular structures such as the cell wall, glycocalyx, and cytoskeleton. 4. Involvement in synthetic biology: In the field of synthetic biology, cell membranes can be artificially reassembled for various applications.",

It prevents harmful substances from entering the cell and maintains the cell's internal environment.\n\n2. Selective Permeability: The membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. It is selectively permeable, allowing certain molecules to pass through while restricting others. This helps maintain the cell's internal balance and regulate the exchange of nutrients, waste products, and ions.\n\n3. Cell-to-Cell Communication: The membrane plays a crucial role in cell signaling. It contains receptors and signaling molecules that allow cells to communicate with each other. This communication is essential for coordination of various cellular processes and responses to external stimuli.\n\n4. Attachment Surface: The cell membrane serves as an attachment surface for various extracellular structures. It helps in cell adhesion, allowing cells to stick to each other or to surfaces. The membrane also provides support for the cell by interacting with the cytoskeleton, a network of protein fibers inside the cell.",

Ultimately, the burden of the tax is determined by the price elasticity of demand and supply for that good or service. It's important to note that the tax revenue is not the only factor in determining tax incidence. Instead, the focus is on how the tax affects the prices and quantities of the good or service bought and sold. The introduction of a tax drives a wedge between the buying and selling prices, and the incidence of the tax depends on which group, buyers or sellers, is more responsive to price changes. In general, if demand for a good is more elastic than supply (buyers are more responsive to price changes), then the tax burden will fall more heavily on buyers. Conversely, if supply is more elastic than demand (sellers are more responsive to price changes), then the tax burden will fall more heavily on sellers. It's important to note that tax incidence analysis is a theoretical construct and does not take into account other factors that may influence the ultimate distribution of tax burdens, such as tax avoidance strategies,",

The burden of the tax is ultimately borne by one or more of these groups.\n\nThe French Physiocrats, including Fran\u00e7ois Quesnay, suggested that the burden of taxation falls on landowners and reduces their land rent. However, tax incidence is not solely determined by who collects the revenue. It depends on the price elasticity of demand and supply. \n\nIf the demand for a product is more elastic (responsive to price changes), consumers tend to bear a larger portion of the tax burden. Conversely, if the supply is more elastic (responsive to price changes), producers bear a larger share of the burden.\n\nIn summary, tax incidence is the analysis of who bears the burden of a tax, and it is determined by the price elasticity of demand and supply rather than where the tax revenue is collected.",

Nicks had reportedly used the phrase \"don't come around here no more\" towards her former boyfriend, Joe Walsh, after an argument or a break-up. Petty and his band were opening for Fleetwood Mac on tour at the time, and he was invited to a party at Nicks' place. Petty was unaware of Nicks' identity at first, but later learned that she was the woman who had used the phrase. The title refers to the idea of being unwelcome or no longer wanted in a place or relationship.",

However, it was later embraced and reappropriated by the people of North Carolina. While there are several legends surrounding the origin of the term, one popular belief is that it was a nickname given during the Civil War because of the state's importance to the Confederate side, with the troops being likened to individuals who \"stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels.\"",

According to the document, the exact etymology of the nickname \"Tar Heel\" is unknown, but it is believed to have originated from the state's history of exporting tar, pitch, and turpentine from the vast pine forests. The nickname was initially derogatory, but it was later reappropriated by the people of North Carolina. One legend suggests that the term was given during the Civil War due to the state's importance on the Confederate side and the fact that the troops \"stuck to their ranks like they had tar on their heels.\" However, the exact history of the term is not certain and has led to the development of several legends.",

He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive aid, they would fall to communism, which would have serious consequences for the region and for the national security of the United States. The aid was seen as necessary to prevent the spread of communism and to support these countries in their fight against totalitarian regimes.",

It is suggested in the movie that Jamie may have felt abandoned or unwanted by her foster family, which could have made her more susceptible to Michael's influence. Ultimately, the reasons for Jamie's actions remain open to interpretation.",

A word can stand alone and has its own meaning, whereas a morpheme may or may not be able to stand alone and relies on other morphemes to express a complete idea. A word can be made up of one or more morphemes. For example, the word \"cats\" consists of two morphemes - \"cat\" (a root with its own meaning) and \"-s\" (a plural affix with a grammatical function).",

Based on the information provided in the document, the University of Kentucky has never been recognized as a national champion in football by the NCAA. While the NCAA has never officially recognized a national champion from among the bowl coalition institutions, Jeff Sagarin's computer model retroactively determined Kentucky as the highest ranked team for the 1950 season. However, other polls and organizations have named different teams, such as Oklahoma, Princeton, and Tennessee, as national champions for that year.",

For example, the constellation Orion is named after a hunter in Greek mythology, and the constellation Cassiopeia is named after a queen who was placed in the heavens as a punishment for her arrogance.

In the movie, the women are not depicted as sea creatures or even explicitly identified as Sirens beyond Delmar's belief in their mythological identities. Therefore, while Delmar may believe the women are Sirens, there is no concrete evidence in the text to support this identification.",

For scenes in King's Landing and Daenerys' scenes in Qarth, the city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, was used instead of Malta. The Min\u010deta Tower in Dubrovnik was specifically used as the House of the Undying. Scenes set north of the Wall were filmed in Iceland, specifically on the Vatnaj\u00f6kull, Sv\u00ednafellsj\u00f6kull, and M\u00fdrdalsj\u00f6kull glaciers. Additional shooting locations in Northern Ireland include The Linen Mill Film & Television Studios in Banbridge, Ballintoy Harbour, and Downhill Strand.

It reached tropical storm status the following day, passing south of Barbados and near Saint Vincent. The storm weakened due to moderate wind shear but regained strength over the Bay of Campeche on August 23, becoming a hurricane later that day. It rapidly intensified and made landfall near Rockport, Texas at peak intensity on August 25.",

Based on the provided document, the responsibility for the Reichstag Fire remains an ongoing topic of debate and research, with different historians having different theories on the matter. Some believe that the fire was planned and ordered by the Nazis as a false flag operation, while others believe that it was the result of a protest by the German working class. However, it is important to note that the exact purpose of the fire is still not definitively known and is the subject of ongoing research and debate.",

The concept of a \"quality human being\" can be subjective and culturally influenced, and different people may have different definitions and priorities for what contributes to a happy life. Some people may believe that certain personality traits, such as optimism, resilience, or a strong sense of purpose, are important for happiness, while others may place more emphasis on external factors, such as wealth, social connections, or good health. Ultimately, the relationship between quality of life and the characteristics of individuals is complex and multifaceted, and there is no one answer to this question.",

However, the Gregorian calendar, which is widely used today, has 29 days in leap years, making February the second longest month after February in leap years.",

High Biodiversity: The fynbos biome has an incredibly high level of biodiversity, with over 9000 plant species, of which around 6200 are endemic. This richness in species makes it ecologically significant and contributes to the overall biodiversity of the planet. It is considered to have more botanical diversity than even the Amazon rainforest.\n\n2. Unique Ecosystem Services: The fynbos biome provides numerous ecosystem services that are crucial for both South Africa and the world. These services include water filtration, soil stabilization, carbon sequestration, and pollination. The fynbos plants have adapted to survive in nutrient-poor soils and fire-prone environments, making them valuable in terms of ecological resilience and climate change mitigation.\n\n3. Cultural and Economic Importance: The fynbos biome holds significant cultural and economic value. It is an important part of South Africa's national identity and heritage, with many fynbos plants being used in traditional medicine, art, and cultural practices. Moreover, the fynbos supports a thriving eco-tourism industry, attracting visitors from around the world who come to explore its unique flora and fauna. This industry contributes to local economies and job creation.\n\nOverall, the fynbos biome's biodiversity, ecosystem services, and cultural and economic importance make it a vital and valuable natural asset both to South Africa and the global community.",

The fynbos biome is located in South Africa's Western Cape, which has a level of botanic diversity that exceeds that of the richest tropical rainforest in South America, including the Amazon. This makes it an important area for scientific research and conservation efforts.\n3. The fynbos biome is home to many unique and endemic plant species, including over 600 species of Ericas, which have significant medicinal and economic value.

The figure is believed to represent the spirit of speed and elegance associated with Rolls-Royce automobiles. The design was inspired by a drawing made by the sculptor Charles Robinson Sykes and was first introduced as a hood ornament in 1911. The logo has a rich history, including a legend that it represents the secret love between Montagu, the second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu, and Eleanor Velasco Thornton, the model for the emblem, who were involved in a long-term affair despite Montagu's marriage to another woman.",

He established the Saudi monarchy, which has remained in power since then. The succession to the Saudi Arabian throne was designed to pass from one son of Ibn Saud to another. The current King, Salman, is the son of Ibn Saud, and the next in line, Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, is also a son of Ibn Saud. The monarchy was hereditary by agnatic seniority until 2006, when a royal decree provided that future Saudi kings are to be elected by a committee of Saudi princes. However, the current king, Salman, first chose his nephew and then his son as a crown prince without any consultation with the Allegiance Council.",

In the early 20th century, Ibn Saud embarked on a campaign to unite various tribes and regions in the Arabian Peninsula under his rule. By forming alliances, conquering territories, and negotiating with local leaders, he gradually established his authority and expanded his control. In 1932, he declared the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with himself as the king. The House of Saud has remained in power since then, passing the throne from one son of Ibn Saud to another through hereditary succession.",

Nationalism: The Belgian Revolution of 1830 was sparked by a desire for independence from Dutch rule and a desire for a separate Belgian identity. This sense of nationalism was fueled by the performance of a nationalistic opera and the use of a flag influenced by the Brabant Revolution of 1789.\n2. Economic inequality: The revolution was also driven by economic inequality and discontent among the urban working class. The bourgeoisie in Brussels, who were influenced by the ideals of the French Revolution, were seeking greater political power and economic opportunities.\n3. Political repression: The reign of King William I was seen as oppressive and authoritarian, leading to widespread unrest and a desire for change. The king's rejection of his son's advice to negotiate with the rebels and his decision to send a large military force to suppress the insurrection only served to further inflame tensions and fuel the revolution.",

Instead, it was stationed in Karachi, British India, at the end of 1939. The battalion later served in Iraq and Syria with the 25th Indian Infantry Brigade. In August 1942, the battalion embarked from Egypt for Cyprus but was forced to return due to a torpedo attack. The battalion eventually returned to Syria in May 1943 and was captured by the Germans during the Battle of Leros in November of the same year. The battalion was later reformed in January 1944 and served in the Italian Campaign for the rest of the war.",

These elements include melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre, dynamics, texture, and more. Each element adds its own unique layer to the overall sound. \n\nMelody refers to the main musical line or the tune of a piece. It is usually carried by a lead instrument or a vocalist and forms the foundation of the composition. \n\nHarmony involves the combination of different notes played together to create chords. It adds depth and richness to the music and supports the melody. \n\nRhythm determines the arrangement of time within the piece. It includes elements like beats, tempo, meter, and patterns of accentuation. \n\nTimbre refers to the tone color or quality of sound produced by different instruments or voices. It contributes to the overall texture and character of the music. \n\nDynamics relate to the variations in volume and intensity throughout the composition. Changes in dynamics help create contrast and expression within the piece. \n\nTexture refers to the layering of different sounds and their interaction. It can be thick or thin, depending on the number of instruments playing simultaneously. \n\nIn addition to these elements, there can be additional layers introduced in a piece of music. These may include counterpoint, orchestration, and various effects achieved through techniques or technology. These layers work together to create a multi-dimensional and immersive listening experience.",

This transition results in the absorption of a specific wavelength of light, which is characteristic of the particular molecule. The energy of the absorbed photon is equal to the energy difference between the initial and final energy levels of the electron. UV-Vis spectroscopy is widely used to identify and quantify various molecules in various fields such as chemistry, biology, and materials science. It provides valuable information about the electronic structure of molecules, their concentration, and their interaction with the environment.",

When light is shone through a sample, the molecules absorb certain wavelengths of light, causing a change in the electronic energy state of the molecule. This change in energy state results in the emission of light at a different wavelength, which is detected by a spectrophotometer. The intensity of the absorbed and emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of the molecule. Double-beam instruments use a reference beam and a sample beam to measure the absorption of light by the sample, and the ratio of the two beam intensities is used to determine the concentration of the molecule.",

      "model_response": "The principle of electronic transitions in UV-visible spectroscopy is based on the absorption of light by molecules. When a molecule absorbs light in the UV-visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, it promotes one or more of its electrons from a lower energy level to a higher energy level. This transition occurs when the energy of the absorbed photons matches the energy difference between the two levels. The absorbed light causes an electronic excitation, and the molecule becomes electronically excited.\n\nUV-visible spectroscopy measures the intensity of the light transmitted through a sample or the light absorbed by a sample at different wavelengths in the UV-visible range. By analyzing the absorbance or transmission data, information about the electronic structure and chemical composition of the sample can be obtained. This technique is commonly used in various fields such as chemistry, biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, and environmental sciences, among others, for the analysis of compounds and identification of functional groups.",

The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is a science fiction novel by Douglas Adams, and it is the second book in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series. The story takes place after the events of the first book, and follows the adventures of Zaphod Beeblebrox, Trillian, Arthur Dent, and Ford Prefect as they travel through space and time. The novel is known for its humor, satire, and exploration of philosophical and scientific concepts. The story culminates in a climactic finale at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, a place that exists at the end of time and space, where the characters must confront the ultimate question of the meaning of life, the universe, and everything.",
